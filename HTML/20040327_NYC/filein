DSCN0378.JPG|Thursday: The kids bonded quickly over a game of Risk!
DSCN0379.JPG|And the common language of video games
DSCN0376.JPG|But in the end, after about 32 hours awake (more or less), Laurel crashed hard for the next 16 hours
DSCN0383.JPG|Friday: But she was up first the next morning to find ... three inches of snow!
DSCN0395.JPG|Our address, in case we got lost.
DSCN0386.JPG|The front of our room/apartment.  Very nice housing on the Maguire AFB thanks to Judy and Jim!
DSCN0387.JPG|Turns out snow in New Jersey looks a great deal like snow in the pacific northwest.
DSCN0392.JPG|It was sort of slushy and melted pretty fast
DSCN0393.JPG|By noon it was more or less gone
DSCN0396.JPG|The boys bonded some more ...
DSCN0397.JPG|While the Rebekah and Katie introduced Laurel to the addiction known as: American Girl Dolls
DSCN0410.JPG|Saturday: Philadelphia Day - The Independence Visitor Center in Philadelphia
DSCN0401.JPG|Brian crashed on the sill of the Independence Visitor Center.  Laurel looks on.
DSCN0408.JPG|Independence Hall surrounded by large buildings...
DSCN0413.JPG|Another view of the Hall.
DSCN0415.JPG|Horses and carriages look much like what we have in the northwest as well
DSCN0417.JPG|Brian and Laurel mug for the camera.
DSCN0418.JPG|Some guy wanted to get his picture taken.
DSCN0421.JPG|Historical building across from the Hall.
DSCN0429.JPG|The Father of the American Navy, Commodore John Barry.  Barry's fame has been overshadowed by his contemporary John Paul Jones. The accomplishments of Barry are numerous, including the capture of over 20 British war vessels, quelling three mutinies, and participating in the last battle of the war aboard the frigate Alliance in 1783.
DSCN0430.JPG|More historical buildings whose name I failed to note
DSCN0431.JPG|It looks old, it must be important...
DSCN0432.JPG|The bell tower of Independence Hall.  Did you know that it was in such disrepair that when they signed the Declaration of Independence, they rang most of the bells in town *except* this one!  That's right, the Liberty Bell was one of the few bells in the city *not* rung on that historic day.
DSCN0435.JPG|The court room in the Hall.
DSCN0439.JPG|The seal of Pennsylvania, I think.  It replaced a picture of the king when we threw him out.
DSCN0440.JPG|The room where the delegates spent a long summer.  Benjamin Frankly spent a long time staring at the sun shaped decoration at the top of the chair in the middle of the picture.  When it was all over, he worked it in to his closing speech, pondering whether it was a rising or setting sun. But after the Constitution was drafted, he declared that it was indeed a rising sun.
DSCN0441.JPG|Laurel liked the chandalier.  It was not there originally but was a period piece from somewhere nearby.
DSCN0442.JPG|Another view of the meeting room used by the delegates.  The sun-backed chair sits center stage.
DSCN0443.JPG|Time keeps ticking away...
DSCN0445.JPG|Brian and Laurel in Philadelphia
DSCN0446.JPG|Some guy got in to a picture of the kids
DSCN0447.JPG|Another view of the Hall
DSCN0448.JPG|That same historic building from earlier
DSCN0449.JPG|Top center over the door is a statue of Ben Franklin.  Wearing a toga.  I'm going to go out on a limb and guess this was someone exercising artistic freedom.  I'm guessing Ben wasn't a big toga guy.
DSCN0453.JPG|*The* Liberty Bell.  Or a pretty good facsimile thereof.
DSCN0454.JPG|It was cast by two people who had never done a bell before.  
DSCN0455.JPG|The crack was which showed up was drilled out and a bolt put at the top, the thinking being that it would keep the two drilled surfaces from making contact.  
DSCN0458.JPG|Unfortunately, when they tried to ring it again, *another* crack shot up and to the right and the bell was to never ring again.
DSCN0461.JPG|The Hall from where they keep the Liberty Bell (or a reasonable facsimile thereof)
DSCN0470.JPG|Sunday: Off to NYC.  We parked in New Jersey and took the Staten Island Ferry

DSCN0482.JPG|Skyscrapers!  I think that's the top of the Empire State Building in the top middle.
DSCN0486.JPG|Ground Zero, former home former home of the World Trade Center.  Fenced off with just a few reminders inside of what used to be there.  Flowers on the fences outside.
DSCN0488.JPG|Mounted on the fences were the names of all those lost that day.
DSCN0490.JPG|Tall fences, tall boys, little girls who did not like being in such a big city.
DSCN0494.JPG|China town!  Great souvenirs cheap!
DSCN0495.JPG|My brother in law Jim purchased a Rolex for just $20!  Talked the guy down from $125.  Fake?!?  I saw it, it said Rolex right on it!
DSCN0502.JPG|Some beefy guy holding up some metal hoops.
DSCN0498.JPG|St. Patricks Cathedral
DSCN0503.JPG|Front of the cathedral
DSCN0504.JPG|Nice view of the front
DSCN0509.JPG|Incredible stonework.
DSCN0574.JPG|I can't believe I'm in a place in my life where I can say this, but it actually reminded me inside of the cathedral at Notre Dame.  How cool is that?!
DSCN0578.JPG|Beautiful stained glass
DSCN0579.JPG|Ornate architecture
DSCN0580.JPG|Incredible scale
DSCN0581.JPG|And a kick-butt organ!

DSCN0582.JPG|Tuesday: Feeling a bit under the weather for another trip in to NYC, instead Mom and I headed to Atlantic City to check that out!
DSCN0583.JPG|The road we took leads you right in to Caesars Palace on the left
DSCN0584.JPG|and Trump Plaza on the right.  The Taj was further down boardwalk.
DSCN0585.JPG|More Trump Plaza
DSCN0589.JPG|And that would be Caesar of Caesar's Palace fame.
DSCN0590.JPG|The famous Atlantic City Boardwalk!
DSCN0591.JPG|The buildings were painted in very eye-catchingly bright colors!

DSCN0599.JPG|Wednesday: Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan
DSCN0604.JPG|Laurel and Brian on Liberty Island.  Later Brian had to take off his sweater and wear mine when birds flew over him and deposited waste products down the length of his arm.  I admit I laughed at him.  You would have too!

DSCN0608.JPG|All by herself
DSCN0612.JPG|And with admiring copycats.  Yes, I made her do this one.

				<H2>10:25am</H2> 
				<P>I'm off to France today. Long flight, early out of the house.
				  Need to be to the airport a couple hours before my flight (for I will *not*
				  risk missing this one). </P> 
				<P>But! Must take time for breakfast on this day because it *is*
				  the most important meal of the day. And it'll be hard to forget this last
				  breakfast before leaving the country for a week.</P> 
				<P>Got to the United desk at 10:00. Checked in by 10:10 because
				  there is not any line to speak of. Pretty quiet at the airport. 10:20 and I'm
				  through the metal detector. I have to take out the laptop, put it in it's own
				  basket, jacket in it's own basket, keys and wallet in it's own bowl. So I have
				  to put through two baskets, one backpack, one laptop case and a bowl. My hands
				  are full. Fortunately, nothing on me sets off the metal detector, so no full
				  body cavity search today.</P> 
				<P>Since I did get to the airport early, I get to wait in chairs
				  for over an hour. Hard to do when you can't wait to get on the airplane and get
				  going.</P> 
				<H2>5pm PDT</H2> 
				<P>Right now we're somewhere between Chicago and New York. We're at
				  30,000 feet and it's minu 45 Celcius outside, not to mention a might windy.
				  </P> 
				<P>The flight to Chicago was uneventful and quite full.</P> 
				<P>It's hard to be too eventful when I can't actually sit back
				  comfortably and I certainly can't extend my legs. I was stuck in the middle
				  seat between two other guys. </P> 
				<P>Being typical guys, we attempted to ignore each other's very
				  presence for three hours or whatever the flight was while playing an unspoken
				  game of "Who Gets the Armrest" for four hours.</P> 
				<P>I was definitely tired so I napped a bit, but probably only for
				  10 minutes at a time because much longer than that and my neck got very
				  uncomfortable, not to mention I fear I had a nasty tendency to relax and have
				  my mouth hang open! Not cool.</P> 
				<P>Got in to Chicago on time in concourse B. At that time I had
				  about 25 minutes before my flight so I decided to call home and touch base
				  there. I did get to talk with Laurel, which was nice since I left early enough
				  that I didn't get a chance to say bye to her.</P> 
				<P>I couldn't find the flight mentioned on the screens so I asked
				  someone at another gate and got pointed to concourse C. Turns out it was quite
				  a piece away so by the time I got to the gate, I basically walked on the plane.
				  The plane is a B767-300. This is one of those planes where you walk thru first
				  class (very nice) and then you get to the next cabin which is still nice but
				  not as much. Is this for me? No, this would be business class. Keep walking
				  bucko...</P> 
				<P>The front of the third cabin was labeled Economy Plus. Okay,
				  that's better than nothing, yes? Would be if it were for me. Keep walking
				  partner... </P> 
				<P>Eventually, just before exiting the plane from the back I found
				  my set. In the cattle class, oh, sorry, Economy class, they seat two near the
				  windows, three in the middle. I had a window seat. Under the seat in front of
				  me, where my feet would *like* to go, some metal box took up half the space. I
				  was starting to stress that I was going to have a seat mate. In the end, it
				  didn't happen. Actually cattle class is pretty empty. The middle three seats
				  next to me are empty. If I can't get comfortable in my two seats, I may sleep
				  over there. It's probably five feet wide for the three seats. Nearly
				  comfortable. The most annoying part is the lack of leg room, but I can turn
				  sideways and stretch out a bit. Can't get in to the aisle, though, or else the
				  attendants will run me down as they mosey up and down the aisle.</P> 
				<P>Wonder of wonders! Hot towels. Okay, they're warm and moist and
				  the size of a paper napkin, but they are some sort of cloth and they smell
				  good. Grabbed two and washed my face and hands. Nice! Now I'm lemony fresh!</P>
				
				<P>Now I think I shall read my Paris tour book and get a sense of
				  where I will be staying and how to get there and what I want to see. That
				  should kill a few hours.</P> 
				<P>I don't know if I'll get much/any sleep but that will certainly
				  make it easier to sleep come Saturday night in Paris. Not sure sleeping is what
				  I want to be doing on a Saturday night in Paris, but you gotta start
				  somewhere.</P> </TD>

				<H2>10am</H2> 
				<P>Hit the tarmac in Paris. The airport looks like any other
				  international airport you might imagine, right down to the english signs. But
				  before doing that, I did get a look at dawn over the Atlantic. Kind of
				  <A HREF="Images/DSCN1281.JPG">nice</A>.</P> 
				<P>It's only once you deplane that it becomes clear you're not in
				  Kansas anymore. These people smoke *everywhere*! In shops, in restaurants and
				  bathrooms. Here the designated smoking area is apparently everywhere. </P> 
				<P>I also got lost in the airport. Or rather, I couldn't figure out
				  how to get to Paris from the airport. A taxi is spendy ($60) and there is
				  supposed to be this great metro/subway/train system. If I can figure out how to
				  get there...</P> 
				<P>Turns out what I wanted was the RER, which I had to take a
				  shuttle bus to get to. </P> 
				<P>I suppose I *could* have asked someone but what's the fun in
				  that? If a smart guy can't figure it out without speaking a word of the
				  language, it must be too hard. </P> 
				<P>In the end I paid for a ticket to get on the RER to Paris (about
				  $7). This took me downtown, actually right to the stop I wanted to go to. This
				  would have been a great accomplishment if it had gone well from there. Instead
				  I was trapped inside a multifloor mall and could *not* figure out how to get
				  out! Most people apparently got there on the Metro or drove, so I could find
				  those. Surely *some* of them had come walking in. I just needed to find that
				  entrance! </P> 
				<P>So picture the dumb American, rolling around his luggage, laptop
				  case and backpack through the mall, looking for the exit. Sheesh. </P> 
				<P>Found it in the end. Then I had to walk about six blocks to my
				  hotel. Not bad. </P> 
				<P>That first view of Paris as I exited the mall was really
				  <A HREF="Images/DSCN1283.JPG">something</A>. My first thought was that it
				  looked like something Disney would build. Like the Epcot center view of France.
				  Lots of people, unique <A HREF="Images/DSCN1286.JPG">architecture</A> (unique
				  to me, common as dirt compared to the rest of Paris), really
				  <A HREF="Images/DSCN1282.JPG">neat</A>. </P> 
				<P>I was tired as anything by this time (call it 11:30am local) but
				  I had to stop several times to enjoy some building or cathedral or church.
				  Because I might never be this way again. Really something to see.</P> 
				<P>I needed to figure out which direction to go in since I knew
				  where I was (more or less) and I knew where the hotel was (more or less). So I
				  needed a corner with signs. Well Paris doesn't do signs on the corners. It
				  turns out that on many corners you will find the street name posted on the
				  building at the corner. And if you're lucky standing at a corner, you can see
				  *both* street names. Then you're styling. I, on the other hand, was turned
				  around. So I had to go back the way I had started (only a half block).</P> 
				<P>It turns out the French do have cross walks but it's a bit of a
				  misnomer. I saw several cars just barrel through them. It sort of like you have
				  to have the momentum of several people in the crosswalk before the cars will
				  respect it. I *never* wanted to be the first in the cross walk. So I let women
				  and children enter before me to sacrifice their lives before I risked mine. In
				  the end I saw very few actually get run over but it was a close thing.</P> 
				<P>My hotel was easy to find. The name is the Hotel Violet.
				  Remember that in case you're looking for a very centrally located hotel (just a
				  block from the Metro, if you know the line and stop) with tiny rooms. Very tiny
				  rooms. </P> 
				<P>But what do you really need? It's not like I'm going to spend
				  much time there. But it *is* small.</P> 
				<P>I dumped my stuff and headed for the shower. I looked like I had
				  been run over, propped back up then backed over again.</P> 
				<P>Post shower I was feeling tired but refreshed. So out the door I
				  went!</P> 
				<P>First stop:<A HREF="Images/DSCN1299.JPG"> The Louvre!</A></P> 
				<P>Did I see all the Louvre? Nope. Not enough time. Too much to do.
				  I did what the tour book lovingly referred to as "the jogging tour" of the
				  Louvre. </P> 
				<P>Truth is, I wouldn't know if most of the medieval art was good
				  bad or indifferent. I know the Mona Lisa is supposed to spectacular, but from
				  my experience it's really just an opportunity for tourists to get their picture
				  <A HREF="Images/DSCN1313.JPG">taken in front of it</A> and it's darker than I
				  thought it would be. And smaller.</P> 
				<P>I saw some great <A HREF="Images/DSCN1324.JPG">sculpture</A>,
				  which I like better than the medieval stuff. It has lots of other stuff,
				  including stuff from the northwest indians. There was even a head that looked
				  like it could have been found on <A HREF="Images/DSCN1318.JPG">Easter
				  Island</A>.</P> 
				<P>Truth is, I saw, even at a jog, probably a third to half before
				  I realized I had become numb to art. It happens. Look it up.</P> 
				<P>It would be great to hit it for a couple hours a day for a week.
				  Less risk of overexposure.</P> 
				<P>I also like seeing artists <A HREF="Images/DSCN1317.JPG">coming
				  in</A> to work on copies or <A HREF="Images/DSCN1309.JPG">their
				  interpretations</A> of great pieces. That was cool.</P> 
				<P>I didn't see anyone doing this with the Mona Lisa. That would
				  just take too much cajones, I think.</P> 
				<P>Next stop, find an Internet cafe. The guidebook put one about a
				  mile away, so I hoofed over to that to find it closed with no notion of hours
				  (the guidebook claimed it'd be open today). Uh, oh.</P> 
				<P>I started wandering back towards the Louvre (I was now on the
				  left bank - you can tell which is which bank if you stand on one of the many
				  bridges that span the Seine and face down stream. At that point, those are the
				  left and right banks, respectively). Eventually I ran across a copy center
				  selling Internet access. Cool!</P> 
				<P>I bought a half hour of time, thinking it'd be enough. Then I
				  saw down and found out something. The French are sadists or masochists. One or
				  the other. </P> 
				<P>They moved some of the keys on a standard keyboard around. Not
				  all of them, just some important ones to a touch typer. The A/Q have been
				  swapped as well as theh W/Z and the M has moved next to the L. Think that's not
				  bad? It slowed my typing down to a quarter of normal. Painful. </P> 
				<P>I also grabbed my first Paris food on this outing. It was about
				  2pm and I was famished. I didn't want to sit in a restaurant
				  (bistro/cafe/whatever) so I grabbed some street vendor food. Pretty tasty! Some
				  kind of bread loaf cut in half with goodies cooked in to the middle. They
				  called it a panini. You could gets a variety of goodies, I went for something
				  with sausage and tomato sauce and cheese. </P> 
				<P>Now it was time to hit <A HREF="Images/DSCN1336.JPG">Notre
				  Dame</A>. What an incredible building!</P> 
				<P>It was founded in the 12th century. The flying buttresses were
				  built starting around 1330. That's 670 years! </P> 
				<P>This was the building that had the most effect on me. It was
				  difficult to imagine that kind of age. But if you looked up inside the
				  structure, you could still see where <A HREF="Images/DSCN1361.JPG">smoke had
				  stained the stonework</A> in the ceiling. That stain was probably 500 years
				  old! How amazing. Wonderful stained glass and a simply amazing sense of scale
				  and presence.</P> 
				<P>I brought my tripod to take pictures, knowing that to get
				  pictures inside the <A HREF="Images/DSCN1348.JPG">dim interior</A> I'd need a
				  long exposure. I got a few off before a guard told me no tripods. I wasn't the
				  only one using a tripod but he was adamant. I'll be darned if I can figure out
				  why cameras and video are okay but a long exposure shot on a tripod is bad?
				  Whatever.</P> 
				<P>By the time I got done there it was about 5pm. I headed back to
				  the room since my feet were killing me. In fact I now have a flaming blister on
				  my pinky toe of my left foot. Ouch.</P> 
				<P>Then I fell asleep. This part wasn't really planned but I fell
				  asleep for about an hour while I was resting. Sleepy, sleepy me.</P> 
				<P>About 7:30 I headed out to track and kill dinner. Which turned
				  out to be a real french bistro called, appropriately enough Bistro Romain.</P> 
				<P>I had the special where I got to pick the appetizer (mozarella
				  and tomato with a vinnegrette(?) and the main dish (a salmon and rice dish
				  whose name escapes me) and my dessert (creme brulee). It was all pretty
				  mediocre, I have to say. I had a glass of the house red and it was pretty bite
				  worthy. The only standout was the maitre'd who acted pretty offended and snooty
				  when he figured out I was an American. That was at least an experience.</P> 
				<P>Two hours later I slunk out. Oh, and the creme brulee was burned
				  on the top and the custard was inconsistent. Yick.</P> 
				<P>Now back in the room winding down. Must sleep soon or risk
				  falling over and passing out.</P> 
				<P>Tomorrow I must hunt for souvenirs and other goodies. I also
				  want to do the Arc de Triumph and the Eiffel Tower. Lots of other possibilities
				  depending on how much my feet hurt.</P> </TD>

				<P>I slept pretty well last night. I woke up once in the middle of
				  the night but got back to sleep. I actually had my alarm set to go off at 8am
				  but when it did, it still looked dark outside and Paris was not yet beginning
				  to wake up, so I went back to sleep for another hour.</P> 
				<P>The hotel serves la petite dejeuner (breakfast) which consists
				  of croissants, jam, toast, cereal, some fruit, yogurt, juice. Seemed like a
				  nice light start to my day.</P> 
				<P>Then I was off to see the second days' sights. </P> 
				<P>The weather was very poor today with drizzle all day and lots of
				  fog and low visibility.</P> 
				<P>I hoofed it to the Metro station a block away and began to try
				  and figure out how to use it. It's very complete and very complicated to figure
				  out at first. Buses run on the streets. One level down is the Metro which runs
				  from station to station in a pretty comprehensive and random appearing fashion.
				  A level below that is the RER or trains that run on main lines, more or less
				  East/West and North/South (or something/oest and Nord/Sud) with some variation
				  tossed in. So you have to know the metro line well enough to know if you need
				  the metro, a bus or a train. Then you find the right level. Then you have to
				  get the right direction because the main lines go each way and you figure out
				  the direction by knowing what's at the end of the line.</P> 
				<P>Quick side story. While figuring where to go a guy of 50-ish
				  approached me and asked if I spoke English. Since he didn't look like a begger
				  I replied yes. He told me a sad story of visiting Paris, getting his pocket
				  picked and his flight was later today. He just needed another 5 Euro to get to
				  the airport so he could fly home to San Francisco. He didn't actually come out
				  and ask. He actually asked if I was going to the airport today and if he could
				  bum a ride. I explained I wasn't leaving till tomorrow but yes, I offered to
				  help him. </P> 
				<P>Odds are he was scamming me, in fact it's pretty much the story
				  I'd use if I were trying to scam people without having to physically pick their
				  pocket. Oh, well. It was $5 and was either a good samaritan or it was $5 so I
				  had a story to tell. Good either way. If I could help him improve his scam at
				  all, or even if it was real, he should have asked for an address to send the $5
				  to when he returns. That would have cemented it for me.</P> 
				<P>Anyhow, I did great with finding the right train, going down the
				  metro entrance, down to the train station and catching it towards the Arc de
				  Triumph. That went treally well, I made no mistakes but getting to that train
				  from the Metro station was pretty confusing so I was concerned about my ability
				  to get back to that station (under the metro entrance you may have multiple
				  metro stops accessible to each other and the train).</P> 
				<P>Once you exit the station and climb to the street you get your
				  first view of the <A HREF="Images/DSCN1366.JPG">Arc de Triumph</A> (I call it
				  the Arc for short because I've been there. We're that close now.) It's
				  surrounded by a circular road where a dozen roads come together. But you dare
				  not try and cross to the Arc. One writer called the roundabout "vehicular
				  russian roulette with more bullets than chambers" (death is certain!). Instead
				  you take the <A HREF="Images/DSCN1367.JPG">underground passage</A> and live a
				  little longer.</P> 
				<P>Anyhow the Arc was pretty keen. Very large and impressive in
				  it's scale. I walked up the <A HREF="Images/DSCN1376.JPG">284 steps</A> (they
				  tell you how many it is) to the top of the Arc. There is a museum about the Arc
				  at the top which is pretty neat. Then you go out on the view platform and get a
				  really great view of Paris. Except for the rain. And the wind. And the
				  <A HREF="Images/DSCN1379.JPG">lack of visibility</A>. But other than
				  that...</P> 
				<P>In the end you could see a couple miles before it grayed out.
				  But it does appear as though all of Paris leads to the arch, with a dozen major
				  roads coming together at the Arc.</P> 
				<P>I'm sure it's even better on a day where you're not squinting to
				  keep the rain and wind out of your eyes.</P> 
				<P>Next it was off to the Eiffel Tower, which didn't look promising
				  since you couldn't even see the top from the Arc, which didn't bode well for
				  the visibility from there either.</P> 
				<P>So it was back to decode <A HREF="Images/DSCN1393.JPG">metro</A>
				  again and sure enough it went just right, with just a quarter mile walk to the
				  tower.</P> 
				<P>There are an amazing number of street hawkers around and the<A
				  HREF="Images/DSCN1394.JPG"> Eiffel</A> (again with the first names, because
				  I've been there and we're that close) is no exception. </P> 
				<P>They're pretty universally immigrants, usually from African
				  countries. They push umbrellas connstantly, especially to me since I didn't
				  have one nor need one. I'll dry off, for pete's sake.</P> 
				<P>Anyway, you ride up the first two stops to the
				  <A HREF="Images/DSCN1404.JPG">middle observation deck</A> of the tower. The
				  elevators slide up the angle of the lower legs. Kind of neat. At the middle
				  floor, you can change to the elevator that takes you to the top via a central
				  shaft.</P> 
				<P>Did I mention it was windy? From the top you could feel the
				  nearly 1000ft tower sway. I heard someone say it swayed 5 inches either way in
				  a good wind. Seemed reasonable. It felt a bit like you were on the deck of a
				  ship.</P> 
				<P>The first level of the top observation floor has windows and you
				  can see the city. Some of it anyway, since the fog was still an issue. You
				  could also walk a flight of stairs to the exposed viewing deck. This was a
				  mistake, at least for half the tower since the wind and blowing rain nearly
				  pushed me off the tower! Except for the big fence. And bars. And the fact the
				  wind wasn't *that* strong. But other than that it was bye-bye Darrin! Instead I
				  just got wet.</P> 
				<P>Back down the elevator to the observation deck, I bought some
				  souvenirs. It's hard to find something that doesn't have cheesy souvenir
				  written all over it.</P> 
				<P>On the way back to the metro from the Eiffel, I stopped at a
				  pizza place and had a margarita un jabon (ham pizza) and un coke (a coke). I
				  was sat in tight quarters next to a pair of lovely young ladies chatting up a
				  storm. Turns out they spoke less english than I spoke french. So they went
				  about their business (sipping Espressos) and I mine (eating my jabon and
				  drinking my coke).</P> 
				<P>Back on the metro, I managed to flawlessly unwind my journey,
				  complete with popping out *exactly* the right metro station near my hotel. </P>
				
				<P>I dropped my souvenirs off, lay down on the bed for a half hour
				  to rest my feet (my little toe on my left foot has a MAMMOTH blister from
				  walking - OW!)</P> 
				<P>By that time it was 2:45 and it was time to be off again. I
				  wanted to do some shopping and see another museum. I chose the Pompidou Center
				  since it houses the <A HREF="Images/DSCN1413.JPG">Musee National d'Art
				  Moderne</A>, which loosely translates appears to mean "Art that often looks
				  like junk thrown together or paint splatters".</P> 
				<P>I will be the first to admit to a strong and stubborn ignorance
				  of the merit of much modern art, but I have to respect the lengths these people
				  go to make me say "<A HREF="Images/DSCN1424.JPG">What the hell?!?</A>"</P> 
				<P>You can catch some pictures in the gallery. Some really odd
				  stuff. But there was some stuff that was really keen and catchy. It's just a
				  real mish-mash. Highlights included a piece that looked like a small garden
				  with rows and a few weeds, even a pile of poo and other organic stuff. Where
				  you might have expected veggies, instead it appears to be growing a crop of
				  cactuses (cacti?) and phalluses (phalli?) painted in vibrant colors. I've no
				  idea what the artist was trying to say but it was said with some volume.</P> 
				<P>Another piece had six tanks with goldfish swimming in each one
				  backed with TVs flashing loud and quick MTV style imagery. Several people stood
				  around looking at that one. One gentleman paused in his viewing, leaned over to
				  address the person standing next to him and asked in a nice British accent:
				  "You think it annoys the hell out of the goldfish?" Now that's art that is
				  successful! It makes the viewer ask the big questions...</P> 
				<P>Of less interest was a white room with a big roll of paper about
				  5 inches high. Along the length of three walls, the artist meticulously put
				  small dots, not quite strokes. On the fourth wall were several larger pieces
				  where strokes/dots covered the paper, row after obsessive row. *This* room,
				  unlike most, had a sign outside it saying photography was prohibited. Good
				  thing, I was going to make a huge panorama pic and capture that puppy! What a
				  silly piece. Persistence is NOT art and shouldn't be treated like it is.</P> 
				<P>The highlight for me from the museum was not even on the walls.
				  I was walking the length of a hallway when couple women passed me, both older,
				  say 50+. Something about the gait of the lady on the left first caught my eye.
				  Then the makeup. Then the bad wig. That lady was a dude! And an *ugly*
				  lady!</P> 
				<P>Okay, I wasn't completely sure, so I did an about face, intent
				  on getting ahead of them to take another pass. Turns out I didn't need it
				  because as I prepared to pass I could here him address his wife (they had
				  wedding rings!) in a baritone. </P> 
				<P>So apparently he and his wife are comfortable with his cross
				  dressing. But not comfortable enough that his wife will help him make sure he
				  doesn't get out of the house in an ugly outfit, atrocious makeup and a really
				  bad wig.</P> 
				<P>By this time it was 5:30 and I headed for the shopping district.
				  Unfortunately I learned something it would have been nice to know earlier. The
				  shopping districe, in fact much of Paris save restaurants, shuts down on Sunday
				  at 5pm. Doh!</P> 
				<P>I shopped a bit more in a card shop but after that I was done,
				  grabbed some quick food on the way back to the hotel, for I was seriously out
				  of energy. </P> 
				<P>Got back around 7pm and now I'm catching up on the journal and
				  giving my feet a break.</P> 
				<P>Tomorrow my flight to Nice leaves at 10:40. I asked the guy at
				  the front desk when I needed to leave here to be sure to get to the airport on
				  time to for my flight. After several tries in asking different ways, it became
				  clear he faked english well but understood mine poorly. </P> 
				<P>We did finally establish that I was taking a plane, but given
				  how long it took to do that, I think I mistrust his estimates. I'll just be
				  sure to be early. Though I think I need to get someone here to confirm which
				  terminal (1 or 2, though I'm pretty sure it will be 2, but 2a-2f still needs to
				  be known). </P> 
				<P>So tonight will be a fairly quiet night, which me reading for
				  about an hour then off to bed to try and get myself synced up better. </P> 
				<P>Tomorrow we will spend an hour or two at Infineon, thus
				  beginning to justify my way on this trip. We'll see how it goes.</P> 
				<P>Unsurprisingly, Paris remains largely unexplored by me. There's
				  only so much you can see and do in two days, really a day and a half since I
				  didn't hit the hotel till noon yesterday and I was so tired. </P> 
				<P>You really need to spend four days. And I think spring would be
				  far better or maybe fall, than winter.</P> 
				<P>I've had the TV in the room on for background noise. It's sort
				  of entertaining to try and figure out what's going on without understanding the
				  language. Right now a guy is trying to stab a suit of armor in the head with a
				  spear. I *think* it's the equivalent of the History Channel talking about how
				  effective the armor is at keeping the man from stabbing him in the head.</P> 
				<P>That's it for now...</P> </TD>

				<H2>10:15am</H2> 
				<P>Got checked out in time. Left the hotel about 8:15 for the
				  Metro. Flight is at 10:48am. Including finding the right train, it takes about
				  an hour to get to the airport. </P> 
				<P>Mild panic as I got to the airport. I had one last turnstile to
				  get through to enter the airport. It wanted a Metro ticket. Mine stopped
				  working!</P> 
				<P>I tried several other turnstiles, looked for a ticket machine. I
				  was literally a jumped turnstile away from the safety of the airport.
				  Fortunately someone had left their no longer needed metro ticket on the other
				  side of the turnstile so I reached over, snagged it (no one was around to see)
				  and used *that* to gett in. Problem solved.</P> 
				<P>Then I had to find the Air France desk and the right
				  terminal/gate area. Not too much trouble.</P> 
				<P>All told, I was at my gate by 9:30 for my boarding at 10:15.
				  Oops. Looks like it's time to board for the flight.</P> 
				<H2>1:30pm</H2> 
				<P>Flight is late! I'm supposed to be in Nice by noon so I can be
				  at the customer site by 2pm. I found my bags and grabbed a taxi. I had written
				  out the address so I could give it to the taxi driver who, I quickly
				  established, did not speak English.</P> 
				<P>He drove over 160kph (100mph) to get me where I needed to be and
				  it was still a $50 cab ride.</P> 
				<P>We (I and and the marketing guy I was traveling with, Mick) met
				  with the customer for a couple hours, doing intros and talking about what they
				  wanted to accomplish while we were here. Then, we called it a night and headed
				  back to the hotel with a schedule to return by 9am the next morning.</P> 
				<P>At 6pm Mick and I went looking for a place to eat, with no
				  success. Turns out they don't open up around there until 7pm at the earliest.
				  Fortunately Mick's friend Nevil works in the area so he came and rescued us.
				  First we stopped for a pint of Guinness at a local pub (I was told it was a
				  pretty good pint, but it was hard for me to tell since I had nothing to compare
				  it to on the Guinness front). Then he took us out to dinner at a fantastic
				  place. It was a little place that had great food and atmosphere and was
				  probably in a 300 year old building. Not pretentious at all, it very much felt
				  like a family restaurant.</P> 
				<P>I had sliced duck breast and we had a bottle of wine. Very good.
				  It was called Gigondas. A nice bottle of wine and a good one to share with a
				  friend. Afterwords the hostess brought a "digestive" which sounds much neater
				  in a french accent. It was basically a shot of something very alcoholic which
				  numbed my throat and made my eyes burn.</P> 
				<P>I drank far more than I'm used to that night. Got back to the
				  hotel around 11pm.</P> </TD>

				<P>9am we were at the customer site. Mick worked on getting the
				  test model we converted for them working while I gave a 2 hour whirlwind tour
				  of how to write models using our technology.</P> 
				<P>I clearly gave them too much information too quickly as the two
				  engineers were glassy eyed and looked pretty numb afterwards.</P> 
				<P>We had a cafeteria lunch of some indeterminate sorts of food.
				  Some kind of squash bits and something noodly that had a seafood taste. Some
				  cheese and bread. Great bread here, no question.</P> 
				<P>Then we continued to work with the engineers till about 4pm. We
				  caught a ride back to the Synopsys office in Sophia where we debriefed the
				  local bigwig about what we're doing and what was working and what was not.</P> 
				<P>Since we were in a Synopsys office, I was able to hook up and
				  get email finally.</P> 
				<P>We stayed there until we caught a ride to the hotel around
				  7pm.</P> 
				<P>Back at the hotel, we decided to work out for a bit before
				  dinner. So we rode exercise bikes and I swam a bit. </P> 
				<P>After that and a quick shower we were off walking to dinner. We
				  had only the vaguest ideas where we were going. Basically it was down to the
				  ocean and hang a right. Fifteen minutes later, with me nearly convinced we were
				  lost, we found the place.</P> 
				<P>This place was very much more a "typical" french restaurant.
				  Snooty french waiter that couldn't speak any english, good seafood, nice wine,
				  shots of grappa as a digestive. Pretty spendy but not bad with the entire meal
				  costing $120 for two with wine.</P> 
				<P>Stayed awake till 12:30am before I crashed. Slept mostly till
				  7:40am though I did wake for a bit at 5am.</P> 
				<P>I've yet to see the sea. Or much of anything else in the
				  daytime. I don't expect that to change till my play day on Friday.</P> </TD>

				<P>Breakfast at 8am, Infineon at 9am. </P> 
				<P>Spent more time reviewing the material, looking at the model
				  they converted on their own (in two hours, which is very good). I think we're
				  off to the Synopsys office again near lunch time. I don't know if we'll be back
				  here again later today (I expect so) but hopefully not on Thursday (though I
				  put it at better than 50% odds).</P> 
				<P>Well, I think we're pretty much done with the main part of our
				  trip here so it seems like a good opportunity to update everyone on how things
				  are going.</P> 
				<P>When we arrived at Infineon, we received great news. Florent,
				  one of the Infineon Engineers had successfully converted a Dual Port Ram model
				  to a custom DWMM in just two hours! And it passed all the regression tests.
				  This was great.</P> 
				<P>Michael (the other engineer, whose name is pronounced Michelle)
				  was having a bit of trouble getting the sample testbench working with a couple
				  instances of the DPRAM so we helped with that and pretty quickly demonstrated
				  the ease of Logical Address Mapping these two instances in to a single range of
				  memory (using Device mapping). They liked the combined view and ability to load
				  the memory from a single file. (Sorry, this is the work portion, so it's a bit
				  more technical)</P> 
				<P>Oh, at lunch we met with a manager from Atmel about their memory
				  needs. He provides tools for developers internally as well.</P> 
				<P>But the salad bar was extraordinary. It really was a bar with
				  tons of different salads, not just things to toss on your lettuce. And the
				  bread! I can't get enough of the baguettes!</P> 
				<P>Anyway, back to the work stuff. </P> 
				<P>By the end of Wednesday, they had a working testbench and had
				  begun to play with the tools and could see the testbench commands adding
				  value.</P> 
				<P>Basically, by the end of Wednesday, we had accomplished the main
				  goals for the trip.</P> </TD>

				<P>On Thursday morning we had a meeting at the Sophia office with
				  Jean Christophe Vial (the Infineon Engineering Manager) and Michael.</P> 
				<P>Basically it was for Pierre Bricaud (who arranged the trip) to
				  be sure we had met all the requirements from Infineon and were completely
				  successful. We were. Infineon seems very happy.</P> 
				<P>Both Mick and I gave them cards so if they run in to any
				  technical hurdles, we'll help them be successful.</P> 
				<P>I can really see where this kind of close working relationship
				  gives the customer warm fuzzies and makes them much more trusting of working
				  closely with us.</P> 
				<P>As for Infineon, there is talk about this turning in to a
				  success story, possible paper for DATE or SNUG and all kinds of other good will
				  and good press.</P> 
				<P>We are around the rest of the day Thursday in case Infineon runs
				  in to any issues though I don't expect to hear from them. If that's the case,
				  that'll be it for this trip.</P> 
				<P>A side note: </P> 
				<P>Man but I'm tired of the smoke around here. Going out to lunch
				  is terrible because I come back reeking of smoke. They don't actually smoke in
				  the offices so that's good. According to Mick's friend Nevil, the french do
				  have a law that *requires* separate smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurant
				  but no one enforces it and most restaurants just ignore it.</P> 
				<P>Today for lunch we had couscous! Actually a big stew bowl full
				  of indeterminate pieces of meat, carrots, squash, potatoes and onions. Another
				  giant bowl of couscous. You ladle whopping portions of the one over the other.
				  The squash was a little overcooked (squishy squash == nasty) and the meat
				  really was indeterminate and still attached to large knuckly bits of bone, but
				  it was tasty. I enjoyed it a great deal.</P> 
				<P>I passed on the rose' today as I think I've had enough wine at
				  least till dinner. Here having wine with lunch is just par for the course. In
				  this case the bottle was a generic clear glass with no label that is refilled
				  as needed from some large vat in the back.</P> 
				<P>It was a very popular place. We had to have reservations and we
				  still had to sit outside in the wind and weather. Nippy round here! The clouds
				  came in again and it's 10 degrees colder today compared to yesterday.</P> 
				<P>We had a quiet afternoon on Thursday, just catching up on email
				  and work stuff.</P> 
				<P>Thursday was a very different evening, since it was our "last"
				  in the area (I didn't let the local biz development guy know I was here Friday
				  because he kept talking about making us available to the customer while here
				  and I didn't want to lose my Friday).</P> 
				<P>Nevil, Mick's friend, collected us at 8:15pm. Downtown by 8:30,
				  we had another pint of Guinness. Then off to a pizza place that is nothing like
				  pizza hut. Good but different pizza. Another bottle of red wine.</P> 
				<P>Since nothing happens quickly around here, we got done there
				  around 10pm. Nevil and Mick got to spend a bit of time reminiscing about their
				  University days. It was fun to listen in on.</P> 
				<P>A bit later, Nevil called a friend of his to come join us for a
				  drink out and about. Turned out to be a woman who cooks on the very expensive
				  and exclusive boats that moor 'round here in the off season. She's Canadian
				  originally, but it was hard to tell as her accent was all over the map.
				  Literally. She brought along a couple guy friends.</P> 
				<P>All three work the boats, cooking for well-to-do people with
				  large boats. They go all over the world, either with the boats or switching
				  from boat to boat.</P> 
				<P>Sounds sort of interesting for a chunk of time, I suppose, but
				  definitely a different lifestyle than I could imagine. </P> 
				<P>We stayed for a drink with them. I had a rose', a bit sweet and
				  dessert-like. Then we called that a night and got home by 11:30.</P> 
				<P>These people seemed more than a little worn, world-weary if you
				  will. I couldn't help thinking they were missing out by settling down and
				  building a life, especially by this time of their life (call it 35-45). I'm
				  sure they'd feel similarly confused about my choices.</P> </TD>

				<P>I took a taxi to Nice along the coast from Juan des Pines to
				  Nice. Very pretty. Nice day to start with.</P> 
				<P>I first went to the <A HREF="Images/Picture_003.jpg">Marche des
				  Fleurs</A>. Really, really cool.</P> 
				<P>In addition to flowers (lots even this time of year) there were
				  lots of foods, fresh and cooked. I wanted to bring some of these amazing little
				  sugar things that were shaped like lots of little vegetables and fruits and
				  mushrooms, but you can't take back anything that doesn't come in a
				  jar/bottle/can/etc. Too bad, because they were neat. I took
				  <A HREF="Images/Picture_007.jpg">pics</A> of them though.</P> 
				<P>Then off to<A HREF="Images/Picture_022.jpg"> the beach</A> to
				  look for shells and see that. Nice views, sunshine, people sitting on the beach
				  (on the little round rocks) and walking on the boardwalk.</P> 
				<P>Hung out there watching people for 45 minutes or so. No sand at
				  all, by the way. None to be found up and down pretty much this whole stretch of
				  coast. It was a very nice beach though. Friendly and comfortable. The kind of
				  beach you might skip on, if you were properly motivated. But if you did, I'm
				  pretty sure people would still look at you oddly, saying things about you
				  skipping, but in French.</P> 
				<P>From there I wandered the big pedestrian mall, an outside long
				  alley of shops that runs for a mile or so with lots of little alleys up and
				  down from the main run.</P> 
				<P>Lots of touristy stuff. </P> 
				<P>After shopping for a while, I needed to poo. According to my
				  map, I could find a bathroom a block or two away. I tracked it down and it was
				  *weird*! It was about twice the size of a phone booth with opaque sides. You
				  pay your .30 and get in and the door *whooshes* closed behind you. There is a
				  low-slung toilet which put my hienie about six inches above the floor. When you
				  sat on it it settled another inch or two from your weight. After doing my
				  business, I discovered that the toilet paper did not come off a roll but rather
				  like a napkin dispenser. That was broken. Eventually I used a pen to scoop/pull
				  out enough paper to finish properly and dry my hands from washing them, but it
				  was touch and go. Worse, the entire time, you can hear people walking right by
				  on the busy street. It was not clear to me that I could lock the door so I had
				  to assume it knew it was occupied and wouldn't let anyone else in.</P> 
				<P>An hour later, while shopping in a large shopping area, I
				  discovered I had neglected to zip properly as I had been so focused on
				  finishing and getting out of there before someone else popped in. Always good
				  for the self-esteem.</P> 
				<P>I unfortunately missed what appears to be the annual<A
				  HREF="Images/Picture_040.jpg"> Noel festival </A>in the large park that runs
				  through the middle of town for several miles by one day. Starts tomorrow.
				  Looked like it will be fun.</P> 
				<P>I found a large mall-ish thing though the shops were smaller and
				  the place had a very large number of small shops in a compact area. It seemed
				  like a weird compromise between European small shops and a mall approach. </P> 
				<P>I had lunch there. Pizza again. Very popular here due to the
				  proximity to Italy (20 minutes away). This area has gone back and forth between
				  French control and Italian control over the centuries, so there is a real
				  blurring of culture.</P> 
				<P>No alcohol today. I need a break. Like for the next month or
				  two.</P> 
				<P>I was done by 5pm or so and caught another cab back to Juan des
				  Pines and the hotel.</P> 
				<P>After resting for a half hour it was back out to Juan des Pines
				  in search of a loaf of bread and some water.</P> 
				<P>The place the hotel sent me to had closed from 4-7pm so no joy
				  there. What's up with those hours?</P> 
				<P>Eventually I found something called Casino which turned out to
				  be a small store. Picked up a coke, a baguette and since they only had room
				  temp water, a liter of juice.</P> 
				<P>I'm spending a quiet evening in my room decompressing.</P> 
				<P>The only french I can do reliably is Merci, bonjour, bonsour,
				  oui and no. OK works great here. When I got in to the cab today, I said "Nice,
				  sil vouz plait. Marche des Fleurs." He responded with something fast and french
				  and off we went. Then he tried to ask me something else and I admitted to only
				  speaking english so he gave up other than a bit of english. He asked if I was
				  from London. I guess all us english speakers sound the same. He thought it was
				  neat I was from America. He didn't understand United States or the States.
				  America worked.</P> 
				<P>As I said, I'm all packed up and pretty much ready to go. Just
				  need to get a good night's sleep and get going by 7am tomorrow.</P> 
				<P>I will spend approximately 18 hours in a plane tomorrow, with
				  about three hours of sitting in airports. I hit the ground (ideally) by 8:30ish
				  so out of the airport by 9pm, home by 10pm.</P> </TD>

				<P>Flew home. Very tired. Long flights. No joy. Lost my main
				  luggage when I nearly missed the Paris-&gt;Wash/Dulles connection due to a late
				  arrival. It showed up the next day. At least this time I hadn't packed my car
				  keys in the luggage. So, you see, I can learn, though slowly. </P> 
				<P>The long and short of it is that it was a really great trip,
				  whether you judge by the touristy stuff or the food or the work stuff that went
				  very well. If you're going to travel, though, there's a lot to be said for
				  doing it on the company dime!</P> </TD>

This is what I built on my recent vacation.  I found the plans on the
web and you can access them below.  The chair could even be built by a
complete neophyte like myself, to pretty good effect.  The downside
is, given the cost of materials and tools (bought myself a router!)
and even putting a nominal value on my time, this is certainly the
most expensive chair I've ever owned.  But, it was a lot of fun.<p>

Oh, and I do realize that pine is not the best choice, expecially from
the perspective of being knot-free.  But, it was the most cost
effective choice for the first piece of wood furniture I've ever
built.<p>

Below you'll find the original post this is based on as well as complete instructions for how
to built your <b>own</b> "Jake's Chair".<p>

<h2>The concept</h2>

Long ago, when deep porches surrounded the front of a house, we kids
would gather on Judge Robertson's front porch to discuss the state of
the neighborhood and to plan our day's mischief.  Jake never minded
the extra kids, since he had five of his own to add to our group.
While Spirea bushes helped to cool and conceal the porch on hot summer
days, Jake's big, comfortable, porch chairs were the main attraction.<p>

Wars were fought on those hot Missouri afternoons over who would get
the chairs, and who would be left to sit on the front steps or porch
railing.  All the Judge's chairs were of the same design, and were
made for a big man.  Jake had the chairs built to his own
specifications.  While reminiscent of Adirondack chairs, Jake's Chair
was different.  The back curved gently and the seat was contoured.
The chair was as big as Jake, and just as solid, but retained the
gentle lines of good furniture design.<p>

My recreation of Jake's Chair includes:
<ol>
<li> Level arms reinforced to withstand the weight of a child "perching" on them.
<li> Arms that extend forward to assist in rising from the chair; that
     permit placing a beverage without bending the wrist.
<li> Contoured seat and curved back that is "just right" for use either with or without a cushion.
<li> A deep well at the base of the back to eliminate the "lump" from
     the bend of a cushion and to prevent its movement.
<li> Arms that are at "reading height" for holding a book
<li> Good stability. . . and above all - comfort!
<li> The ability to STACK two or even three chairs, to save floor
     space when storing them for the winter.  
</ol>

JAKE'S CHAIR is designed as a construction project for the beginning
woodworker.  Extensive attention is given to speed and ease of
construction, with a minimum of tools.  While a quite satisfactory
version of Jake's Chair can be built with just a circular saw, saber
saw and drill, optional directions are added for routing many edges
with a 3/8" rounding over bit for a more refined look.  Directions are
aimed at the beginning woodworker, but should not bore even an
experienced person.<p>

Since any project produces scraps, the plans also include a footstool
that can be made using scrap and additional material.  The matching
footstool is as sturdy as Jake's Chair, and is also useful as a step
stool, seat, or even a low table.<p>

Unlike a flat-backed chair recently built on the New Yankee Workshop,
there is no need for stationary tools or difficult compound cuts.
Besides, Jake's Chair is more attractive than Norm's, and can be used
either with or without a cushion.<p>

Since I am also a woodworker, practical advice is given in the
selection of the material at the lumberyard along with a discussion of
layout of the pattern pieces on the boards to save lumber.
Flexibility of construction and material are a hallmark of JAKE'S
CHAIR.  For example, only two small cuts need to be deepened if the
builder decides to use 1" or even 1- 1/2" material.  These places are
clearly marked on the plans.<p>

The plans, photographs and text file  for Jake's chair 
and its matching footstool are available in .ZIP format 
absolutely FREE <a href="ftp://ftp.mindspring.com/pub/users/scoundrl/jake.zip">here</a>. 

Included in the file is a great blow-by-blow description of how to
build the chair, individual drawings or each part in .bmp format, that
can be printed out on typing paper, photos of the completed chair and
detail photos of the different views- all color coded to the plans.
The .bmp format is the format used by PAINT, included in all Windows
packages.<p>

The file is an example of how Internet and rec.woodworking can be used
by us to transmit plans, drawings and pictures to enhance our
discussions on rec.woodworking.  The only formal requirement is that
the plans and photos not be sold.  You are free to copy them and share
them with others, however.  Chairs built from the plans may be sold
commercially, if desired.  My only requirement for use of the plans
and photos is that the chair and footstool always be identified as a
"Jake's Chair."<p>

<b>Note:</b>Last revised April 08, 1998 (see bottom for notes on
revisions) For a breakout of changes, see the footnote at the bottom
of this article.<p>
                          
<h2>Forward</h2>


Jake's Chair was started in my home shop in 1987 in response to a need
for some chairs on our deck.  At first, my wife and I looked at the
commercially available Adirondack chairs and were disappointed.  While
most appeared to be sturdy, we felt that they were too narrow and had
arms that were too short or narrow for holding a beverage and to
assist in leaving the chair.  Most were designed with straight lines
and were generally uncomfortable.  I'm a good sized man, and
appreciate a chair that is both sturdy and comfortable.  Overall, we
felt that the commercially available Adirondack chairs were designed
for convenience or economy of construction, rather than for comfort.<p>


As we would try the commercial chairs, I would make comments to my
wife about the missing or uncomfortable features, and would compare
them unfavorably to the chairs we both remembered from our childhood
on Jake's front porch.  She finally told me, "Let's stop looking at
chairs and you go home and build the perfect chair. . . like Jake had
on his front porch."  I took that as a challenge and a week later, we
had guests over to try the first scrap-wood prototype of Jake's Chair.<p>


The guests were honest in their comments, and a number of
small revisions were made.  In addition, I refined many
construction problems so that the fifth and (almost) final
version of Jake's Chair was not only simpler to build than
most of the commercial Adirondack chairs, it was far
sturdier and more comfortable.<p>


I have a wonderful wife who has never objected to the common sense
purchase of tools for my shop.  As a result, I have a reasonably
complete wood working shop with planer, jointer, radial arm saw, band
saw, table saw, table router and shaper.  Since I intended for Jake's
Chair to be built by anyone, the sixth and final revision of the plans
was based on constructing it with just the basic hand tools.  I felt
that if I could build Jake's Chair using a drill, hand router,
circular saw and saber saw, that most weekend carpenters could do the
same.  More extensive tools in your shop only will make it easier and
faster.<p>


I also was quite firm in my decision to work strictly with lumber
measuring 3/4" thick.  Jake's Chair is not compromised at all by the
use of the thinner material, yet the weight and looks are much better
than commercial chairs that require thicker parts in some areas.<p>


In preparing the plans for JAKE'S CHAIR, I included the drawings and
material for the footstool.  The footstool and JAKE'S CHAIR are a
perfect match, and you would really be cheating yourself by not
building the footstool at the same time you build JAKE'S CHAIR.<p>


I also give definitions or explanations for the terms I use.  For
example, when I describe the material, I may refer to it as a 1" X 12"
board.  However, I will also note that the board will measure 3/4" by
11 1/2" when measured.<p>


I would like to hear from you about your experience building JAKE'S
CHAIR and any suggestions or comments you might have.  I lost my
hearing many years ago, so your comments to me should be either by
e-mail, letter, or by FAX.  By the way, NONE of this material is
protected by copyright.  I honestly hope that you GIVE these plans or
patterns to your children or relatives when you are finished with
them.  I do ask that these plans not be reproduced for resale.  You
are free to sell the finished chair, however.  If you sell the chair
or give it away, please let the new owner know that its called a
"Jake's Chair" in honor of Judge Josiah Marion (Jake) Robertson, of
Marshall MO who first designed it for his front porch.<p>

Assuming no knots and 14' or longer lengths, I have found the
following amounts of wood adequate to build one Jake's Chair-<p>

Lumber list- see discussion below<br>
Jake's Chair only:<br>
<ul>
<li>(32) linear feet of 12" wood, OR
<li>(40) linear feet of 10" wood, OR
<li>(36) linear feet of  8" wood + (6) linear feet of 10" wood
</ul>

A 27" wide footstool requires the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>(10) linear feet of 10" wood, OR
<li>(12) linear feet of 8" wood
</ul>

On a general note, the wider wood gives you more flexibility in
layout, hence more efficient use of the lumber.  Therefore, less
material is required to form the individual pieces.  Should your wood
contain large knots or cracks, the quantity required for a Jake's
Chair or footstool will naturally increase.  For less than perfect
wood, shorter pieces or narrower widths, I recommend increasing the
quantity by as much as 30%.  You can always find something to do with
any scraps.<p>

Hardware list- galvanized deck-type or stainless steel screws 
(read entire article before purchasing)<br>

<h2>Material</h2>

JAKE'S CHAIR can be built out of virtually any wood.  If your plans
include painting JAKE'S CHAIR, pine (SPF) lumber can be used.  For a
natural look outdoors, there are several woods that work well.  I have
used Cypress for the chairs on my own deck, but have seen rough sawn
Western Red Cedar used as well.  Hardwoods, such as Oak, Mahogany or
Pau Lope are also good choices, but difficult to always locate in
adequate widths.  Where available, Redwood or Juniper would also work
well.<p>


When purchasing the wood, you will find the patterns are easier and
more efficient to lay out on the wider pieces.  This is particularly
true when there are knots.  Buying the longest lumber you can easily
handle in your shop also gives your more flexibility in layout.<p>


<b>Pine</b>- If the chair is to be painted, the most economical choice
is #2 SPF (Spruce, Fir, Pine) in 1" X 10" or 1" X 12" widths.  The
resulting finished lumber will thus measure 3/4" X 9-1/2" or 11-1/2".
Lately, there has been a premium on the 12" width and I advise against
wasting the money.  I prefer to pick through the lumber at the lumber
yard and buy the boards in 14' or longer lengths.  Since the lumber is
so inexpensive, you can afford to "cut around" knots. Be sure that the
boards aren't very cupped, since they cannot be used for the larger
pieces.  If some of the SPF is cupped, use it for the narrower parts,
and not the legs, seat frame or arms.<p>

<b>Redwood</b>- This soft outdoor wood works well for JAKE'S CHAIR.
Redwood is usually available in the preferred wider widths and comes
S4S (surfaced four sides).  While costing usually more per board foot,
there is some economy in premium Redwood, since there are no knots to
"cut around."  The S4S finish is also quite comfortable against the
skin when using JAKE'S CHAIR.<p>


<b>Western Red Cedar</b>- This inexpensive wood is almost always sold
in its rough sawn form.  That means that you will either have to learn
to love the feel of the rough wood on your arms and back, or will have
to sand or plane it smooth.  A friend of mine built several JAKE'S
CHAIRS from the rough sawn material, and while they looked nice, I did
not like the feel.  In my own shop, I have a planer that will quickly
smooth the wood.  However, since 1" Western Red Cedar is usually sold
rough sawn 3/4" thick or even less, the planed material is almost too
thin to be used in the legs or seat frame.  Overall, I discourage its
use, unless you can obtain it in S4S finish in 4/4 thickness.<p>


<b>Cypress</b>- This wood is easily obtained along the East Coast, but
becomes more "exotic" inland.  It is as easy to work with as Western
Red Cedar, but lasts practically forever outdoors.  I prefer to
purchase it in 4/4 thickness (this is a lumber term meaning that is a
full 1" thickness and is pronounced "four quarter") and plane it
slightly to smooth it up.  In North Carolina, 4/4 Cypress in random
widths costs about $2 per board foot.  I have purchased it as cheaply
as $1.35/bf and for as much as $2.35/bf.  (A board foot of lumber is
one square foot of material 1" thick) You have to hunt for Cypress
wider than 8", but it is usually available.  I usually save the wider
material for the arms and seat frame, and use the narrower material
for the balance of the chair.<p>

<b>Juniper</b>- This is also available at lumber yards offering
alternative woods to CCA treated lumber for outdoor use.  It is a tiny
bit softer than Cypress, but planes up beautifully with a more
pronounced grain structure.  It is slightly redder in its freshly
sanded color, but ages like cypress.<p>


<b>Oak</b>- If you have a planer, rough Oak is a reasonable material
to use for JAKE'S CHAIR.  However, if you can only locate white or red
oak in its S4S finished form at a hardware store or lumber yard, it's
just not worth the price.  Unfinished 4/4 white oak costs about $2.50
per board foot around here, while the S4S material (usually gift
wrapped) costs as much as four times as much.  Unlike the above woods,
the oak should be painted or varnished with spar varnish to protect it
from moisture.<p>


<b>Pau Lope</b>- I have just learned about this exotic outdoor wood
and am anxious to try it.  It is almost four times as strong as pine,
won't burn, has the weathering ability of concrete and the look of
mahogany.  On the downside, it appears to be quite hard and care has
to be taken in predrilling every hole.  Carbide tools also appear to
be required.<p>


<b>Suggestion</b>- Why not go to the lumber yard and get enough #2 SPF
to build your first JAKE'S CHAIR?  Like so many other projects, JAKE'S
CHAIR improves the second and subsequent times you build it.  If you
are like me, you will make silly mistakes when you build JAKE'S CHAIR
the first time.  The plans you have were copied from the sixth
generation of patterns I used in developing the chair and footstool.
I suggest that you build your first JAKE'S CHAIR from inexpensive #2
SPF and then disassemble it and use the pieces as your reference for
the "good wood."<p>

If you have scrap 3/4" plywood, that will work as well. The only
drawback is that plywood is very difficult to route well.  Since the
first JAKE'S CHAIR will be your practice piece, and that includes
routing the edges, I really suggest investing in expensive pine for
smoother cuts and realistic routing practice.<p>

<b>Screws</b>- The only other materials required are the four basic
screw lengths used in JAKE'S CHAIR.  These are #6 or #8 galvanized
wood screws.  The lengths are 1-1/4", 1-5/8" 2" and 3-1/2".  The
shortest screws are used to join material side-to- side, while the
1-5/8" ones are used to fasten the arms, braces, seat slats and back
in place. The slightly greater length gives increased holding power in
the softer woods.  The longest screws are used to fasten and reinforce
the upper back support to the Arm Runners.  The finest screws are the
galvanized or stainless ones from McFeeley's in Lynchburg, VA.  They
come with the preferred square or "Robertson" drive heads.<p>

There are many Jake's Chairs out in the world today that have been
built using drywall-type screws.  These screws are both thinner in
cross section and are threaded entirely to the head.  Wood screws, on
the other hand have a stronger shear/tension load and have a smooth
shank area to permit drawing pieces together tighter.  In Jake's Chair
and footstool, you can use either type with no problem, since the
screws are not highly stressed in any location and I have taken care
to insure that there is plenty of excess in the quantity of screws
needed.<p>

On the footstool, the 1-1/4" screws are again used to join the ends to
the riser, while the 1-5/8" screws join the slats to the ends and hold
the support in place.  The one exception is the 2" screw inserted
through the end and riser into the upper part of the support, and used
in attaching the lower back support to the seat frame.<p>

Remember, if Jake's Chair is to be left outdoors, galvanized screws
are a necessity- even if you plan to paint the chair and footstool.
For those of you who will be drilling clearance holes for the shank of
the screw and carefully countersinking the head, #8 screws are
preferable.  For those of you who will be relying on the screw drawing
its own head into the work (self sinking), then the smaller #6 size
will reduce cracking.  If building the chair from hardwoods, there is
no choice but to drill the clearance holes and countersink, while the
softer SPF, Cypress and Redwoods permit some leeway.<p>


Those of you using Western Red Cedar or even Mahogany should only
consider stainless steel screws, since galvanized screws will blacken
the wood near the screw.<p>

I personally recommend drilling clearance holes and countersinks in
all selections of wood and particulary where the screw is close to the
end of the pieces, as in the seat slats and braces.<p>


<pre>
         SCREWS- #8 RECOMMENDED
LENGTH       JAKE'S CHAIR    Footstool     Total
1-1/4"            16           8            24
1-5/8"            68          36           108
2"                 4           2             6
3-1/2"             4                         4
4"                 4 pan head 10/24 or 1/4-20 bolt
</pre>

<b>Suggestion</b>- the only reason the 1-1/4" screws are recommended
is because longer screws, countersunk deeply, would penetrate through
the material.  However, if your wood measures thicker than 3/4", you
can and should use a longer screw for additional strength.<p>

Stainless steel sheet metal-type flush wood screws are also available
in similar lengths.  However, where the galvanized deck screws cost
less than $.03 each, the stainless steel screws are about $.15 each.
If you choose brass, which I discourage, the cost jumps to about $.25
each. Galvanized screws will eventually darken the wood where they
contact it, while the more expensive stainless steel screws will not.
You have to decide if the additional cost and time drilling
countersink holes is worth it. Remember, western red cedar or Mahogany
REQUIRE stainless steel screws to prevent blackening around the hole.<p>

When you buy the screws, I suggest that you purchase more than
required in case you lose some, decide to add more than I did, or in
the event I miscounted.  While the cost of the screws is not much, by
purchasing them in bulk, rather than packaged at a lumber yard selling
deck materials, might save some money.<p>


Remember, that if you are not using WOOD SCREWS, you may be using
screws that MAY BE threaded clear to the head.  As a result, they will
not draw the pieces together like a wood screw will.  It may be
necessary to clamp the pieces tightly before inserting the screw, or
to drill a larger clearance hole in the piece holding the screw head
to permit slippage.  Most galvanized decking screws have the profile
and threads of drywall screws, but have no threads near the heads.
These are the best screws to use, in my opinion.<p>


<h2>Tools</h2>

The basic handtools found in most shops are adequate
to build JAKE'S CHAIR.  However, four power tools are almost
essential; these are the saber saw, circular saw,  variable
speed reversible drill and router.<p>


The circular saw is very good at ripping the material for the straight
cuts and the saber saw is perfect for the cuts needed on the seat
frame, arm and the braces.  If you do not use an electric drill for
the pilot holes or as a screwdriver, your arms will look like Popeye's
after a few hours of screwing in all the screws.  The router is
necessary to give the chair a finished look and to eliminate sharp
edges.<p>


Let's talk some common sense for a moment.  The chances are very good
that the first JAKE'S CHAIR you build will not be your last.  From my
own experience, the chair looks so good and is so comfortable that you
will want several for your own patio or deck.  In addition, you may
decide to build a few to give to the kids or friends at Christmas.
Once you start building JAKE'S CHAIRS, you will be unusual if you
don't build many more.  There is magic in taking some flat boards and
turning them into a comfortable chair.<p>


In addition, it obviously does not take four times as long to build
four chairs.  Just as in industry, performing each step for multiple
JAKE'S CHAIRS and footstools reduces the overall time spent per chair
and thus gives an economy of scale.<p>


To me, that alone is a good reason to invest in the basic woodworking
tools like a router, saber saw, variable speed drill and circular saw.
All of the tools should last a long time, and the accuracy and time
savings are well worth the initial cost.  If you're a casual
weekender, I suggest that you consider the Sears saws and routers when
they are on sale.<p>

<b>Suggestion</b> If you're like most of us, the problem is that your
spouse will object loudly to you buying the tools.  The solution I
recommend for this problem is to first purchase the lumber and screws
for the chair.  Arrange the lumber on saw horses and then ask the
spouse to hold the lumber while you saw and rip out the pieces with a
handsaw.  Explain that the help is necessary, since the handsaw
requires a helper to hold the wood.  When the spouse sees you
struggling and suffering with the handsaw, explain how a $50 circular
saw would let you finish in 1/10 the time, not require a helper, and
give better results.<p>


If you follow my advice and build the first JAKE'S CHAIR of #2 SPF for
the practice, the router will be easy to justify to the spouse.
Without routing the edges of the material, the edges are sharp and the
overall look of JAKE'S CHAIR is unrefined.  Rounding the edges in the
indicated areas gives JAKE'S CHAIR a totally different look that I
consider essential.  Showing your spouse the assembled pattern chair
without the routing will almost always result in your being permitted
to buy a router. I suggest a carbide combination blade for the
circular saw, a 14 tpi (tooth per inch) blade for the jig saw and a
3/8" radius, ball bearing piloted, rounding over router bit.<p>


<h2>Tool list- in order of importance</h2>

<ul>
<li>3/8" variable speed reversible drill
<li>#2 Phillips screwdriver bit for drill
<li>1/8" bit for pilot holes for deck screws
<li>#6 combination countersink and pilot for wood screws- not
     recommended
<li>7-1/4" circular saw
<li>combination blade- carbide preferred
<li>rip fence for saw
<li>Jig saw - appx. 14 TPI blade
<li>Router- 1hp or more recommended with 1/4" collet
     3/8" carbide bearing piloted rounding over bit with 1/4"
     shaft
<li>Router pad- carpet padding will do
<li>Belt sander- 3" by 21" belt sander is very handy to smooth
     edges and surfaces before assembly.  However, a sanding
     block will work also.
<li>Palm finishing sander- very useful to finish sand the
     surfaces
</ul>

The method I prefer is to first enlarge the drawings using standard
drawing tools and drafting techniques.  There are no difficult angles,
curves or critical shapes.  Take your time, have fun and don't worry
if an ogee isn't precisely like shown on the drawing.  You can do the
drawing of the parts directly onto 3/16" luan mahogany plywood<p>


Another technique would be to draw the parts full-size on paper, then
glue the full-sized plan to a piece of thin material.  While
scaling-up the plans on a computer and printing them out full-size is
possible, the simplicity of each part of Jake's Chair and footstool
make it easier and faster to simply redraw the pieces full size.<p>


I prefer either 3/16" tempered hardboard or 1/4" luan plywood as
pattern stock.  Most lumber yards have the thinner materials available
in 4' by 4' sheets as well as the larger 4' by 8' sizes.<p>

The shapes are then cut out with the jigsaw and the edges sanded
smooth.<p>


If you're typical, you'll be building many Jake's Chairs, so take your
time and be careful in scaling the plans up and making your templates
out of hardboard or plywood.  It is practically guaranteed that
neighbors and friends will love the chair and want you to make others
for them, so hang onto your templates.  Jake's Chair and footstool are
very "forgiving" of inaccuracies and mistakes.  If you make a small
mistake in scaling the plans up, you still will probably end up with a
great chair.<p>


<h2>Step 2 : Make sanding board</h2>

Even with the 4' by 4' thin pattern material, there will be a scrap
left.  That scrap is valuable, since most folks do not have a long-bed
planer or table sander.  By gluing four sheets of 80 grit sandpaper
end to end on the scrap, the resulting 8-1/2" by 44" sandpaper covered
board is ideal for truing edges to eliminate any waves.  Lay the
sanding board on the workbench or floor and rub the cutoff edge of the
wood or pattern back and forth over the sanding board to straighten
any edges.<p>

<h2>Step 3 : Copying Patterns to Lumber</h2>

<b>Note:</b> be sure to read "Layout of Back " before copying the
pattern for the back to lumber.<p>


Since the widths of the material can vary, it is impractical to
provide a layout of the pattern onto lumber.  In addition, if knots
are encountered, any scheme is thrown off.  However, some pieces can
be nested to eliminate waste.  The seat frames and arms are best cut
from 10" material, where they can nest well. Likewise, while the back
supports can be nested on 10" material, placing them individually on
narrower material with other odd shapes, such as that angle braces on
the "inside" of the curve works better for me.  Since the wider wood
is generally more expensive per board foot than the narrower cuts, I
prefer to buy the minimum amount of 10" material, and concentrate on
the more available 8" widths for the majority of the pieces.<p>


Assuming no knots and 14' or longer lengths, I have found the
following amounts of wood adequate to build one Jake's Chair-<p>

<ul>
<li>(32) linear feet of 12" wood, OR
<li>(40) linear feet of 10" wood, OR
<li>(36) linear feet of  8" wood + (6) linear feet of 10" wood
</ul>

A 27" wide footstool requires the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>(10) linear feet of 10" wood, OR
<li>(12) linear feet of 8" wood
</ul>

The footstool may also be built less than 27" wide (the width of the
chair).  I have built them as narrow as 20" with good looking results.
Reducing the width of the footstool to 20" saves 2' of length for
either of the above widths.  In the image at the beginning, you can
see both the 27" and 20" footstools in foreground<p>


I have tried to eliminate the 10" requirement for cutting out
the seat frames (8" material is 7-1/2" wide), but reducing
the depth of the seat frame beyond what I show makes them too
weak.  However, if someone is brave enough to try a hardwood,
such as Pau Lope or Oak, they might reduce the depth of the
seat frame by that additional 1/2".  If you simply cannot
locate any 10" lumber, lay the bottom of the seat frame along
the edge of the 8" material and reduce the height of the stop
on the top of the seat frame.<p>

<b>Some</b> of the stop is necessary to orient the lower back support,
but since most of it is not visible from the front of Jake's Chair,
having it not match the height of the lower back support is not too
terrible.  Sanding the mismatch in height further reduces the problem.<p>


The only adjustments to the plans that should be made, but are not
absolutely necessary, depend on the finished thickness of the lower
back support and arm runners.<p>


The two "ears, or tips" of the lower back support rest on the
seat frame against the stops.<p>

Ears and stops should be the same width as the frame.
Likewise, the thickness of the arm runners determine the
overall length of the upper back support.<p>

As shown on the plans, it is 25-1/2" long, since two 3/4" thick
runners were assumed for an overall 27" width.  If thicker or thinner
material is used, subtract the width of TWO arm runners from 27" to
determine the proper length of the upper back support. If you're off
by a bit, nobody will notice.<p>


<b>WARNING</b> Remember that the saw blade removes about 1/8" of kerf
per cut.  As a result, straight pieces that will be ripped MUST be
separated by 1/8" when laying the pattern out.  Likewise, the ends of
the material will be reduced by the same 1/8" kerf, so leave adequate
room between the pieces on the board.<p>


After building your first Jake's Chair and footstool, you will find
that it isn't always necessary to lay out all the rectangular pieces,
such as seat slats, legs, back etc.  Instead, an experienced builder
will simply set the rip guide on his circular saw to the desired
width, and will rip the appropriate length of material.  Once ripped,
the material is then cut to length.<p>

<h2>Layout of Back</h2>

The back of Jake's Chair consists of seven boards.  The boards are cut
square on the bottom, but the tops are cut so that when assembled, the
boards form a rounded shape.  While the pattern shows the final
rounded shape and rough shape, it is easier, and more accurate, in my
opinion, to directly copy the curve to the boards.  Here's how:<p>

Rather than cut the seven back pieces to the length and shape shown,
the preferred way is to cut seven boards for the back to a width of
3-1/4" and a uniform length of 31" long.  This is far easier for
layout.<p>


Then, place the boards together, face down,  on a flat
surface.  The corners of the bottom of the back slats touch.
The top pieces are flared to a width of 28" across the top
BEFORE MARKING THE RADIUS.  Be careful that 
when the seven slats are laid out, that the gap between 
the tops of all seven boards is uniform and that the center 
of the center slat is 14" from the top outside corners.<p>

Since the top pieces are flared, and the bottom corners of each board
touch, the bottom of the slats will take on a natural "curvature" as
well.  This is desirable, and part of the overall scheme and design of
the chair.<p>

Now, measure down 17-1/4" from the top center of the center slat and
make a mark on the slat.  The mark should be in the CENTER of the
board.  Using this point as the center of a circle, draw a 17" radius
circle across the top of the seven slats, using either a beam compass
of a pencil tied with string.  These seven marks are the top of the
slats and will take on a uniform curve when installed according to the
directions that come later in this description.<p>

<h2>Step 4 : Cutting</h2>

After laying out all of the pieces for both the chair and footstool
(34 pieces for JAKE'S CHAIR and 21 for the footstool) first cut out
the irregularly shaped pieces with the jig saw.  The remaining
straight cuts can then be made with the circular saw.  You will soon
see that aligning the most frequent pieces, such as seat slats and
back slats permits the longest and easiest rip cuts.  In addition, you
will soon begin to wish you had a table saw.  Perhaps your spouse
should be watching. . .<p>


When laying out the arms of the chair, remember that the left and
right arms are mirror images of one another.  Since wood will warp
slightly when damp, it is necessary to orient the left and right arms
with the annular rings "up" (also known as bark side up) so that
swelling will cup the sides or the arm downward and center upward,
thus permitting water to run off more easily.<p>

Holding the sanding board with a foot or knee, rub the ripped pieces
back and forth on the sandpaper (at an angle to the grain) until the
edges are straight.  Those of you with a long-bed jointer will find
this operation easier.  Ends should be sanded as well, since the
router's pilot bearing rests on the smooth edge to guide the bit.
Curved edges can be smoothed by a sanding block, but some people might
prefer to use a drum sander in the drill for this.  The sanding drum
is inexpensive and improves the outcome.  Thin saber saw blades often
bend sideways with use.  This leaves a cut that slopes.  Be very
certain that the cut edges are square to the face of the lumber, and
not sloping.  Those of you with a belt sander know that the rounded
end of the sander will sand out curves well.<p>


<h2>Step 5 : Routing</h2>

Place the routing pad on the workbench and round over the edges ONLY
IN THE AREAS SHOWN on the plans. <b>Note</b>: ON THE PLANS, ROUNDED
AREAS ARE SHOWN WITH A DASHED LINE AS OPPOSED TO A SOLID ONE.  Edges
that are to be joined with other pieces are left square, for the most
bearing surface and to improve looks.  If you have a router table, all
routing can be done on the table.  Always feed the work slowly against
the rotation of the router bit.  When working with the softer woods
like Cypress and Redwood, remember to go just fast enough to prevent
burning.<p>


<h2>Step 6 : Sanding</h2>

Even the best router bit will occasionally leave a rough edge on
softwoods.  The only solution is to take a sanding block with 100 grit
paper and start to work.  If you have a belt sander, I recommend
clamping the sander upside down on your workbench to make a miniature
table sander.  100 grit belts will quickly smooth out the roughest
edges and will even give a reasonable finish to the flat surfaces.
The round ends of most belt sanders fit well into the curved areas.<p>

<b>Suggestion</b> The easiest time to do your sanding is before
beginning the assembly of the chair or footstool.  While there is the
tendency to "see how it's going to look," the hour or so taken in
finish sanding all pieces will result in a much more refined and
comfortable chair.<p>

<h2>Step 7 : Initial Drilling</h2>

Again, my assembly technique differs slightly from the traditional
method.  Since Jake's Chair allows freedom of thickness in the
selected material, the location of screw pilot holes will also differ
slightly to "hit" the middle of the adjoining piece.  The location of
the screw holes at the end of the lower back support are a good
example.  In my own shop, I prefer to countersink (for screw heads)
once the piece is ready to be installed.  That way, I can consider
which side of the wood appears to go best on the surfaces.  My advice
to new builders is to mark the location of screw holes, but to wait
until ready for assembly before drilling or countersinking the holes.<p>


The four "interior" screw holes in the lower back support, all holes
in the front legs, arm runner and arms may be predrilled from the
pattern.  However, the outer screw holes on the lower back support and
seat slats should be drilled to "hit" the middle of the seat frame
edge.  I prefer drilling only as the pieces are clamped for assembly,
except as noted below.<p>


At this stage, drill the holes with a 1/8" bit, and be sure that scrap
lumber is beneath the hole when the drill bit exits the piece.  That
way, the bit will not splinter the wood as it cuts through.<p>


The 1-1/2" seat slats have one hole at each end to join them to the
seat frame and the front (2") seat slat has two holes at each end for
more strength.  Seat slats and the slats in the footstool warrant
predrilling and countersinking, due to the narrow wood's tendency to
split.<p>

<h2>Step 8 - Jake's Chair Assembly</h2>
Begin the assembly by placing the seat frames upright,
parallel and square 27" (outside measurement) from each
other.  Place the lower back support on the top of the seat
frame with the "ears" firmly against the stops.  The ends of
the lower back support should be flush with the sides of the
seat frames.<p>


Using the approximate hole locations from the pattern of the lower
back support. drill through the lower back support and into the seat
frame with the 1/8" bit.  Then, remove the lower back support and
redrill the four holes in it using the #6 or #8 countersink and pilot.
DO NOT USE THE PILOT ON THE SEAT FRAME HOLES.  The screw heads should
be just slightly recessed.  Because of the direction the grain runs,
do not overtighten.<p>


The reason for redrilling the pilot hole and countersink in just the
upper piece is that the new pilot hole will be too large in diameter
to permit the screws to firmly grip the seat frame.  This is ideal in
assembly, since tightening the screws will permit thread slippage in
the upper piece and the smaller 1/8" hole in the lower piece will
cause the upper to be drawn tightly against the lower piece.<p>


This technique is used throughout the entire assembly.<p>


Glue the area of contact with exterior glue and then insert
the 2" screws in the holes and drive them home.<p>


Before installing the 2" by 27" front seat slat, place the front edge
of the seat frame on scraps of 1/4" material to raise it slightly
above the workbench.  Since the slats all have rounded edges, this
will permit the rounded portion of the first slat to slightly
"overlay" the front of the seat frame and to hide its lower front
corner.<p>


Position the wide (2" by 27") seat slat against the front of the seat
frame.  Like the lower back support, it should be flush with the sides
of the seat frame with the lower edge flat against the workbench, 1/4"
lower than the seat frame.  Again, drill two 1/8" pilot holes in each
end and into the seat frame.  Remove the front seat slat and redrill
it with the countersink pilot bit.  Finally, attach it to the seat
frame firmly with glue and four 1-5/8" screws and then retighten the
four 2" screws in the lower back support.<p>


The next step is to turn the seat over and install
the two "L"-shaped corner brackets under the lower back
support to hold it firmly at right angles to the seat frames.
The screws run from the 
lower back support down into the corner brackets and from the
seat frame into the corner brackets.  While it would be possible to
hide the screws more effectively by installing them from the 
underside, the counterbore and countersink would reduce the
strength of these small pieces too much. Be  careful to drill 
clearance  holes and countersink into the corner bracket, 
or splitting will occur.<p>


The corner braces should be adequate to force the two seat frames          
into square, but be careful that the seat frames also remain 
parallel with each other and are not racked into a parallelogram
shape..<p>


Now, using two small scraps of 1/4" material as spacers
between each seat slat, begin at the front slat and
glue/screw each seat slat to the seat frame. The only wide 
seat slat is the one used as the starter at the front.  
All others are the narrow ones.  As you approach the back 
support in the rear, adjust your spacing to give  an even 
spacing between the final 2-3 slats, with any over/under
remaining on the seat frame being hidden under the lower 
back support. This area is hidden from view in the finished chair.<p>


The narrow seat slats are important to the comfort of a Jake's 
Chair.  When sitting in the chair, the slats actually "give" a bit 
at the points of maximum pressure, much as a spring might "give." 
The results are a wooden chair that actually conforms a bit to
the shape and weight of the person sitting in it.<p>


Install the arm braces to the OUTSIDE, top,middle of the front legs,
being sure that they are flush with the top to support the arms and
arm runners, which are installed on the INSIDE of the front legs.  The
screws run from INSIDE the front legs into the arm braces.<p>


Cut two scraps of wood 10-1/2" long and use them to support
the front seat slat 10-1/2" above the workbench.  This is
the height of the front slat above the workbench.  Using 4
screws and glue, clamp and then fasten the front legs to the
outside of the seat frame 3" back from the lower front tip
of the SEAT FRAME (not front slat), being sure that the legs 
are plumb. The screws pass from inside the seat 
frame out into the front legs.<p>


<b>Note:</b> It should be emphasized that the front edge of the front
leg should intersect the bottom of the seat frame assembly at a point
3" rearward of the front seat frame end.<p>


Now, glue, clamp and screw the arm runners to the INSIDE of
the front legs, making sure that they are flush at the top and front of the
front legs, and are perfectly level with the workbench.  The
screws pass again from INSIDE the arm runners into the front
legs.<p>


An alternate assembly technique (rather than building in
place) is to assemble the front legs, arm runners and arm
braces before attaching them to the seat frame.  I have done
it both ways and there are advantages to both techniques.  As your
experience in building Jake's chair increases, you will probably
find it preferable to build the arm/leg assembly separately.<p>


The next step is to glue and screw the UPPER back support
between the arm runners in the position shown 
on the plans.  However, only ONE screw per side is installed and no
glue is used initially.  This permits it to swivel a bit to 
meet the seat back at a right angle when it is installed.<p>


Using the position of the FRONT screw shown on the plans, drill
through the arm runner and install a temporary 1-5/8" screw into the
upper back support.  The support should be initially tipped at about
a 30 degree angle to the workbench to approximate the angle of the
finished seat back.  The lower edge of the upper back support should
be approximately just "inside" the lower rear corner of the arm 
runner.  The actual placement is not critical.<p>


The center seat back slat is now installed, being sure that
the bottom of the slat is FLUSH with the bottom of the lower
back support, that it is in the center of the lower back
support, and that it is plumb.  Two screws attach it at both
the upper and lower back braces.  Remember to swivel the
upper back support so that it is at right angles to the slope
of  the back slat.<p>


Now, install a second screw (1-5/8" TEMPORARY screw) through
the arm runners into the upper back support. Later, these screws
will be removed and replaced with 3-1/2" screws for more strength.
Installing the longer screws at this point would promote splitting
of the wood.<p>


At this point, the arms are fastened to the arm runners.  Pilot holes
are predrilled as shown on the plans for alignment with the arm
runners and arm braces.  Be careful to keep the holes above the middle
of the boards and use glue as well.  Remember, also, that the arms
must be installed "bark side up" to help reduce cupping when wet.<p>


The rest of the seat back slats are now installed.  Work from the
middle slat outward, keeping the INNER BOTTOM CORNER OF THE NEW SLAT
touching the corner of the existing slat.  There is NO GAP at the
bottom and about a 3/8" gap at the top.  Since the slats fan outward
toward the top by about 3/8" each, each slat will intersect an inner
slat corner slightly "lower down" on the lower back support in an arc.
This is why the holes are not predrilled, since there are too many
variables in where the holes would be.  Use two screws at both the
upper and lower back support contact points.<p>


The outermost seat back slats are intended to clear the inside of the
arms by about 1/4".  I recommend spacing the slats all at once and
adjusting them for uniform gaps at the top.  The final top of the
chair back should measure about 26" at its widest point.<p>


The outermost seat back slats are fastened to the LOWER back brace
using the same 1-5/8" wood screws as the other slats.  However,
the slats are attached to the UPPER back brace by drilling completely
through the slats and brace with a 1/4" bit and inserting the four
10-24 or 1/4-20 pan head bolts.  Secure them with a flat washer
and nut.  These bolts will supply a "clamping pressure" on the grain
of the upper back brace, preventing splitting when subjected to 
stress or rain.<p>


After the four bolts have been installed, remove the temporary
1-5/8" screws connecting the arm runners to the upper back brace
and redrill the pilot holes to the full depth of the bit.  Then,
carefully insert the four 3-1/2" screws for the permanent
installation.<p>


Finally, turn the finished chair over and nail on two of the nylon
glides to each of the front legs and one to the flattened portion
of the seat frame. <p>


Congratulations, you now own a wonderful Jake's Chair!!!!!

<h2>Step 9 : Footstool Assembly</h2>

To assemble the footstool, the first step is to install the corner
braces to the center of one end of each riser.  Be sure that the edge
of the corner brace is flush with the end of the riser.  Screw through
the riser into the brace. Then, glue, clamp and screw the upper and
lower footstool ends to the 12-1/2" tall risers, screwing from inside
out.  The frames are installed on the "outside" of the risers.  Now,
stand the risers up and plumb them with the corner braces to the
inside on the top.  Screw one of the narrow slats across the center of
the top or the upper frame, covering up the corner braces with the
slat.  Once screwed to the frames, using one screw on each end, screw
two additional screws up from the corner brace into the bottom of the
center slat.<p>


Now, screw each of the two wide slats to the lower frame on either
side of the riser. This will help to keep the two risers parallel and
plumb for the remainder of the assembly.  Finally, install the
remaining slats to the upper frame and lower frame, spacing them
equally. Remember to equalize the distance between the risers and the
angled corner of the lower frame.  This is done by eye.<p>


I have found equalizing the appearance of the slats to be easier 
by doing the following:  First set the slats on the ends of
the upper fame, then the slats on the angles and finally
"average" the slats between the angled slat and the one
previously installed in the middle.  If the plans were
adhered to carefully, the spacing should work out to the 1/4"
recommended.<p>

The final step in assembling the footstool is to turn the
finished footstool over and nail on the four remaining nylon
glides.  Remember to nail them to the LOWER FRAME and not to
the lower slat.<p>


Congratulations!  You have now finished the footstool, also. <p>

<hr>

Many folks will want to stain Jake's Chair or paint it.  While I
originally elected to let my cypress versions weather naturally, the
original Jake's Chairs on Jake's front porch were painted with white
enamel.  After several years of my own chairs natural weathering, I
tired of the dark silver patina.  The chairs were pressure washed and
stained with Cabot's cedar-colored deck stain.  The choice is highly
personal and about any solution is acceptable.<p>


If you elect to paint Jake's Chair and footstool, first prime
the wood with an oil based wood primer, such as Rustoleum for
Wood.  Finish with an enamel of the desired color.  Should a
color other than pure white be used, clearcoating the chair
with a spar polyurethane can be done for added weather
resistance.  However, the spar polyurethane has a dark yellow
cast and will change the color of the chair appreciably.<p>


Staining is best done with an oil based wiping stain or wood
dye.  After applying the stain to a small area with a sponge
brush and allowing it to soak in, wipe the area with a dry
rag to remove any excess. Follow up with two coats of clear
polyurethane for indoor use or the darker spar polyurethane
for outdoor use.  Finally, sand the cured finish (about 7
days) with 220 grit paper to remove any raised grain and then
apply one more coat.<p>


Another process would be to use an outdoor penetrating deck
stain (actually a linseed oil and dye combination) that
contains a UV blocker.<p>

<b>Footnote:</b>

CHANGES to JAKE'S CHAIR- the following has now been incorporated in
the text of the article.  The footnote is for folks who may have
already built Jake's Chair and might want to make the changes without
having to re-read the entire article.<p>


When I was first designing the Jake's Chair and footstool, I built 
chairs from scrap wood to test out the fit and feel of the chair.  
It took about six "generations" of trial and error chairs until I 
felt that I had the best combination of comfort and ease of 
construction.  Some of the original Jake's Chairs are now almost 
ten years old, and I recently had the great opportunity to examine 
a couple that had been continuously exposed to the elements for 
those ten years without any benefit of maintenance.<p>


The chairs in question had been in use during all that time, had 
been left to remain outside during winter months, and had been 
subjected to some harsh use by college students, including one who 
weighed in at over 350 pounds. Both chairs were still functional, 
though one had to have its back propped up by a board to prevent 
it from becoming a recliner.  By examining the chairs, I made a 
couple of observations where the original design could be 
improved. <p>


I want to share those improvements with you, and will also be 
including this note in the file jake.txt, which is included in the 
master file, jake.zip, in my FTP site.  <p>


If you have built a Jake's Chair, you might consider making these 
modifications NOW, instead of making them as a "fix," later on.<p>


Both modifications center around what I call the "UPPER BACK 
SUPPORT" in the plans and text.  Since the upper back support is 
rounded and cut from a wide board, it can split along the grain 
line when subjected to long-term bad weather or abuse.  Folks who 
have built the chair may recall that the seat back slats are 
fastened to the lower and upper back support with 1-1/2" screws.  
The solution to the splitting  is to merely replace the two short 
screws holding the outermost seat back slats to the upper back 
support, with small bolts that run THROUGH the entire support, 
with a washer and nut on the rear.  The bolts will subject the 
wood to sufficient clamping pressure that it should not split with 
age.  In a pinch, even a 3" wood screw would probably be 
sufficient to prevent splitting.  I recommend either using either 
1/4-20 or 10-32 pan head screws or carriage bolts.  4" lengths 
would be more than adequate, with the excess being cut off and 
smoothed up with a file.<p>


The second problem I observed, again involved the upper back 
support, but with splitting out where it was fastened to the arm 
rest supports.  There, my original design used a 1-1/2"  and a 2" 
wood screw driven into the end of the support from the arm rest 
support.  While there may be more elegant solutions, my remedial 
action was to merely reposition the pieces slightly, drill new 
pilot holes, and substitute in 3-1/2" screws.  These pulled down 
really well and should have been made a part of the original 
design.  The only caution is that the pilot hole for the screws 
should NOT intersect the outermost carriage bolt that is holding 
the seat back slat.  The screws should be installed AFTER the seat 
slat bolts have been installed, to prevent splitting.<p>


While not as important as the changes noted above, I have also found 
that the use of nail-on nylon button glides to the legs of the chair 
and base of the footstool are a good touch.  The button glides hold
the wooden base of the chair up a tad, permitting it to dry faster
after a rain, and the gap also prevents wicking of water into the
exposed ends of the legs.  When stained, the nylon buttons also prevent
the chair's color from rubbing off onto the deck or patio.<p>


On a more pleasant note, my dear wife pointed out a feature of the 
Jake's Chair that I had always taken for granted, but had not 
mentioned in print.  That feature is that the Jake's Chairs can be 
stacked!  During winter months, some folks may want to retire 
their Jake's Chairs to the basement or to a shed.  Since the arms 
are so wide and deep on the Jake's Chair, one chair may be placed 
on top of another to reduce the amount of floor space required.  
I've been doing it for years, though I never thought to mention it 
to others.<p>


I sincerely apologize to the thousands of folks who have written 
me to tell me about having built a Jake's Chair for not having 
caught the design problem with the upper back support earlier.  
However, the "fix" is so simple and quick that I doubt if anyone 
will object to making the improvements.  <p>

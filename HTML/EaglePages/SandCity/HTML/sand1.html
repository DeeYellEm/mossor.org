Welcome to my report on "Sand in the City '98"!<p>
First, some history: This is the 3rd annual Sand in the City competition.  This years event included the 
participation of 18 corporate teams.  The main host was Yoshida's (Mr. Yoshida welcomed us to the event.
I'm guessing he drinks <b>way</b> too much coffee).  The participants were:
<ul>
<li>Yoshida Group
<li>Meier and Franks Sponsors Bridge Builders
<li>Thurber Works
<li>Key Bank
<li>Northwest Natural Gas
<li>Synopsys, Inc
<li>Walsh Construction Co
<li>CFI ProServices, Inc
<li>OHSU-Doernbecher Children's Hospital
<li>Yorke and Curtis Construction
<li>Hanna Andersson
<li>Davis, Wright, Tremaine
<li>Standard Insurance Co
<li>US Bank
<li>Media Sculpture
<li>PacifiCorp
<li>Wells Fargo Bank
<li>Hoffman Construction Co
</ul>

Each group was assisted by an architectural firm, ours was represented by Cheryl Gates of Barrentine, Bates, Lee AIA<p>

The event was to benefit "Kids on the Block" which, to all
appearances, takes large, scary looking puppets run by adults that
never learned the idea of not moving ones lips in to
schools and terrifies children.<p>
Now the official blurb will actually tell you the following 
(but believe who you will...):<p>

<blockquote>
"The Kids on the Block Awareness Program uses child-size puppets to
help children accept and understand differences in one another and
learn to protect themselves in difficult situations.  Children are
currently educated in the the areas of blindness, cerebral palsy,
deafness, learning differences, mental retardation, ADHD, aging,
cultural differences, divorce, feelings, gangs and violence, sexual
abuse, and vandalism."
</blockquote>

Our team was made up of the following stout-hearted volunteers
(If I missed anyone, please let me know):
<ul>
  <li>Gordon Battaile
  <li>Andrea Goss
  <li>Helen Harro
  <li>Tom Kiley
  <li>Larry Moore
  <li>Darrin Mossor
  <li>Ed Prichard
  <li>Mindy Richards
  <li>Ann Saalfeld
  <li>Vickie Olson
  <li>Zhi Wang
  <li>Leslie White
  <li>Bill Wickart (Prune)
  <li>Mike Robinson (Team Leader and Artistic Visionary)
  <li>Cheryl Gates (Architect from BBL)
</ul>

After several meetings brainstorming ideas, we struck upon the idea of
"Beachcombing", a visual pun involving a hand rising out of the sand
combing the beach.  From there, we messed around a bit more until our
artistic visionary came to the forefront.  Mike Robinson stepped up
with a sketch and eventually a model of our sculpture.<p>
From there, we built forms from plywood and two-by-fours to hold our
sand (note to self: Next year, use 3/4 inch plywood.  Half-inch
<b>will</b> bulge with several hundred pounds of sand in it).<p>

We met downtown in Pioneer Courthouse Square around 9:30am on Friday,
July 10th.  We would have from 10:30 to 4:30.  A horn would blow at
the end and that would be it.

I had to leave early for another activity I was double-booked for
(SportsFest Golf!  Oh, whatta day...) so I wasn't there for the last
hour and a half, but it apparently went swimmingly.  Kudos to the team.

Well, enough gabbing, let's take a look at some pictures.  I've broken
them in to three areas to lessen the load of the graphics.  Feel free
to poke around and if you have any feedback, feel free to let me
know.<p>

Just a note about the pictures.  They were taken from my video camera
via "Snappy" into my PC.  You'll note that in Rainer's pictures (taken
with a real digital camera) the quality is much nicer and brighter and
sharper.  If you find the first three groups of pictures too dark, you
may want to kick up the brightness when looking at the pictures.  If
you still have problems, please see the admissions representative for
a full refund on your visit.

Finally, I would like to recommend this event to anyone when it rolls
around next year.  It really was a team effort.  All contributed and
it would not have been successful without the efforts of everyone on
the team.  I think everyone had a good time and I hope the team is
happy with the results.  It was alot of fun and the results were worth
the effort.  Thanks,<p>

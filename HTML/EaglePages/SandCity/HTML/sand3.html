<H1>Shots of Other Sculptures</H1>

<img src="../Images/master1.JPG"><br>
Here are some of the Master Sculptors working on something.  Not bad.  We could show them
a thing or two (*Sheeyah!*)<p>

<img src="../Images/misc1.JPG"><br>
Being a kid thing, large animals seemed pretty popular<p>

<img src="../Images/misc2.JPG"><br>
Look a bunny on his belly!  Oooooo...<p>

<img src="../Images/misc3.JPG"><br>
This was a very nice looking lion resting on a book.  Turned out pretty sharp.<p>

<img src="../Images/misc4.JPG"><br>
Um.  A kid.  In a thing.  With a fish.<br>
In fairness, on Saturday, I heard that at least one of the scultures basically collapsed,
causing the team to lose their main shape for carving.  This could be that one.<p>

<img src="../Images/misc5.JPG"><br>
I wish I had taken a better shot of this one.  It was a mouse, surfing the Web.  A bit geeky (mouse ...
surfing ... Web...), but it looked very good.<p>

<img src="../Images/misc6.JPG"><br>
The Hanna Andersson entry.  I believe this won best design.  It was certainly the best design within
the theme of the event<p>

<img src="../Images/misc7.JPG"><br>
This one was pretty sharp looking<p>

<img src="../Images/misc8.JPG"><br>
Some roundy shaped people things and a blob with a hoop.  There you go.<p>

<img src="../Images/misc9.JPG"><br>
My daughter like this one.  Elmo and Oscar the Grouch.  What you can't see very well in this 
shot is the mermaid plastered up against the can on the right.  Don't know <b>what</b> she's
doing there unless Oscar has a date later...<p>

<img src="../Images/misc10.JPG"><br>
This is a nice miniature golf hole.  The trees use a very nice dribbled sand technique.<p>

<H1>Crowd Shots</H1>

The organizers were running a path around the 18 entries.  During the hour or so
I was there, the path was consistently fairly crowded<p>

The weather was about 72 degrees and partly cloudy.  Plenty warm.  The crowds were nowhere
near overwhelming.  A nice day at the square.<p>

Look.  More crowd.<p>

You try to take a shot of the crowd, and some sharp looking young man steps in to the
picture.  What're you going to do?  (That's my son, Brian)<p>

Same deal.  My daughter Laurel.  If I ever wonder why I wanted to do the parent thing,
a smile like that pretty much brings it home.  Hey!  It's my pictures and my write-up, I get to
brag about my kids if I want to ;-)<p>

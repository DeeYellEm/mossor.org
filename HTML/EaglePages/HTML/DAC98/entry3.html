<b>Subject:</b> DAC Update - Chapter 3: The End ... and a beginning?<br>
<b>Date:</b> Thu, 18 Jun 1998 12:00:21 -0700 (PDT)<p>

It's time for the final update from DAC.  Today, we'll learn:
<ul>
<li>Why you should never let under-trained engineers operate WindRiver software
<li>Where to find the best chinese food in SF.
<li>Just how late *did* Ellie and Larry stay out last night?
<li>Why am I writing this when theoretically Robo and I should be demoing in the 	
    suites?
<li>So, just how much *does* the Imperial Room that Robo and I broke into go     
    for?
<li>How quickly can I get the hell home?
<li>So, any Pentiums go missing this DAC?
</ul>

So I had been stressing yesterday after our first demo because the LiveTarget 
stuff was not working properly.  As should probably have been expected, in cases 
like this, it usually comes down to user error.  Turns out we were not exiting 
cleanly when completing, in this case, our initial test run.  So, things were 
hosed more and more as we continued.  After some email traded with Mat (thanks 
Mat!) Robo and I figured out that *Mat* should be down here giving the demos.<p>

Eventually we got it all cleaned up and understood better how we were supposed 
to run things (who reads the well written directions provided in a file called 
README?  That's what *I* want to know...)<p>

====<p>

After the demos (we finished at 5pm), Ellie took us to what is reputed to be 
some of the best Chinese food in SF, a place called "The House of NanKing".  She 
didn't remember exactly where it was, claiming it was just a hole in the wall 
near the Holiday Inn.  <p>

So, we wandered down to China Town and began the search.  We wandered out of the 
main touristy parts of China Town, into and through the Asian Banking Quarter, 
and into a less, how shall I say, prosperous part of town.  We eventually did 
find the place, located between a bar called "A place to meet good friends and 
women" (couldn't vouch for the former, but they were certainly lacking in the 
latter) and an Asian massage parlor.  We knew we were in the right place when we 
found a hole in the wall with a line of 10 or so people out on the street!<p>

By the time we got to the front of the line, the lady kept letting other sized 
groups in ahead of us.  Apparently groups of four are hard to seat.  Who knew?  
Eventually we were seated.  Imagine, if you will, a diner with tables crammed 
against the wall.  To get to the spots on the backsides of the tables, the 
chairs must be slid aside and the table slid out, like some sort of giant 
15-puzzle.  After you're seated, the table and chairs are replaced.  You are 
close enough to rub elbows (and share food) with the people next to you.  It was 
a very friendly atmosphere.  God help us if there had been a fire, since a 
speedy exit was not in the cards.  <p>

They brought menus and cans of soda (nothing on tap). When the owner came by to 
take our order, we apparently made a critical error.  We hesitated.  Before we 
knew what was going on, the owner snatched our menus from our hands and said 
"I'll take care of it".  <p>

So, eating dinner at this place was a bit like opening presents on Christmas 
morning.  You weren't sure what you were going to get!  You'd look at the people 
that were there before us and wonder "Will I get that?  What *is* that?"  When 
the food came, it was very, very good.  We did get a couple of appetizers and 
four dishes.  That wasn't enough, so we had another.  Ellie claimed she was 
full, but that didn't stop her from preying on the additional dish!  For all 
this, the food was very reasonably priced.<p>

====<p>

After walking back to our rooms (spying more cockroaches - now that we're on to 
them, we can foil their evil invasion plans!  Ha Ha!!!) we headed our separate 
ways.  Around 11pm, Ellie got a call.  From Simon Bennett.  He and Larry and 
Richard Pugh and some other fellows were in the bar and wanted Ellie to join 
them.  All I can tell you is that when you don't get to bed till 2am, early 
floor duty becomes very unappealing, or so I've heard...  Still, when we bumped 
into Larry leaving the hotel, he had a smile on his face, so who knows...<p>

====<p>
  
Turns out an analyst was coming to the 11am slot and Dave pressed Jay into 
service to run the demo to present a united Marketeering front.  My guess is 
that there was some fear Robo or I might get asked a tough question and 
accidentally tell the truth.<p>

====<p>

So, just to demonstrate just how small a town SF is, the other morning Robo 
happened to come out of his room and pass the Imperial Room just as the current 
occupants were exiting.  He asked them a few questions, admitted to breaking in 
to their room (before these guys checked in) and learned a bit more about how 
nice the place is.<p>

Later, as we pulled into the end of the line at the House of NanKing, who should 
get in line behind us but the *very* same couple.  I asked them how much the 
place goes for and he told me $2500 a night and that it's almost always rented 
by companies doing business meetings.  I'm going to see if for my next trip to 
SF, Geoff will spring for this room if I promise to have at least one business 
meeting.  I bet he will...<p>

====<p>

Well, DAC is coming to a close.  At noon, Robo and I will help Jay pack things 
up in the suite.  We have to wait for the NCS guys to come pick up the box 
rented by the other groups and then we'll head for the airport.  We're trying to 
get an earlier flight in hopes of getting home a bit quicker.  We'll see how it 
goes.<p>

I have to say, for all that I got much more confident and at ease giving those 
demos, Jay, Ellie and Dave Park have got some sort of special talent.  I never 
saw them get flustered and they always seemed to have a good answer for the 
tough questions.  Maybe that's one of the special talents you acquire when you 
go to the Dark Side (kind of like Darth Vader's ability to throw space junk at 
Luke just by waving at it!)  Needless to say, this is not a skill I'm in any 
hurry to acquire, but it's good to see it when it's used to serve good (us) and 
not evil (Mentor).<p>

====<p>

Finally, I'll pass on a few anecdotes I heard while here at DAC:<p>
<ul>
  <li>The Synopsys theme this year is "The Soul of Silicon".  Larry was quizzing 
Ellie, trying to figure out just what the heck this means.  Ellie tried to give 
him an explanation involving the birthing process, some organic bringing 
together of the elements of life, or something like that.  Larry concluded in 
his inimitable fashion my concluding "So, we're bragging about bringing life to 
sand!"

  <li>Turns out that while no Pentiums went missing that I heard about, some clever 
thieves acquired some Sun badges and removed three full systems from the floor, 
claiming that they needed to be worked on.  These individuals signed release 
forms and everything and wandered off with their booty.  No one figured it out 
for some time...  I hope the airport people don't check Larry's luggage *too* 
closely.

       <li>Finally, as I mentioned earlier, the theme of the Synopsys booth was "The Soul 
of Silicon".  To support that, there was a video playing in the booth going on 
about this in several languages.  Someone really should have paid closer 
attention to the video, because it turns out the German translation touts 
Synopsys' claim to "The Soul of Silicone".  Take that "Ich bin ein Berliner"!

</ul>

That's it for now as I have to go help Jay now.  I won't be checking this email 
account any more, so don't bother to send any negative feedback to this email 
address.  The positive stuff you can send to me at my normal email address ;-)<p>

That's it for the 35th annual DAC.  I'll see you all on Friday!<p>

"They're off!!"<p>
Gates bang open.  Fifteen horses bolt for the rail.<p>

The first turn: red leads, then white, then the others.<p>
Yellow "Eat My Dust" trails them all.<p>

Rounding the turn: Yellow accelerates, leaves the pack behind.<p>

The home stretch: Passes white, neck-in-neck with red.<p>
Jockeys whips fly.  Crowd roars.<p>

Eat My Dust wins.

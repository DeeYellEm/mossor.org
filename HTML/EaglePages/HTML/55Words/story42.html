<hr>
Skydiving was their life, but he wanted out.<br>
At 15,000 feet, he shouted "I'm miserable, I want a divorce!"<br>
"Fine by me!" came the reply.<p>

He pulled his rip cord, but nothing happened.<br>
"Damn, who packed this thing!" he yelled desperately,
trying the rip cord repeatedly.<br>
"Me" she said quietly, as she reached for hers.

The stapler loomed large, its giant, ominous shadow
waking her from tortured sleep.  What was its meaning?<p>

She struggled for clarity, fear gripping her as
the menacing image clouded her mind.<p>

The stapler had been joining little printouts to the 
front of a familiar form.<p>

She jerked awake in shock!<p>

Damn!  It's April 16th!!!

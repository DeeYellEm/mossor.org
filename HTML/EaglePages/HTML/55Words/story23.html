<hr>
Long beautiful blonde hair.<br>
Blues eyes like I'd first seen nearly 20 years ago.<p>

I asked for a kiss, she just turned her head. <br>
Nearly broke my heart. I persisted. She relented.<p>  

Finally, a simple kiss. She even offered a hug. <br>
I was on top of the world.  <p>

"Good night" I said. <br>
"Good night, Daddy".

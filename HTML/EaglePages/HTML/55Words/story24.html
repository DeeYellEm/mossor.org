Most of us have read or been read children's stories.<p>

Memories of our favorites stay with us.  But how often
do these provide images that apply to "real" life??<p>

When was the last time one of those images came into your life?<p>

For me, Monday.  First time I can remember.<p>

Which story might that be??<p>

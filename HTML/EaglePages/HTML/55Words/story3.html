   Morning run, 5AM, fourth mile.  Faintly, far behind, I hear footsteps.
Longer, heavier; coming closer.<p>

   Turn left; peek back.  He's tall, dark, rugged.  Why me?
No purse ... uh-oh!<p>

   I accelerate.  He, too, still gaining.  I hear panting.
I panic, run flat out.<p>

   Contact!  A light shoulder slap.<p>

   "Nice running!"  His warm baritone passes and disappears.<p>

Stepping into the fresh morning air, I found my newspaper near the
sidewalk.   My neighbor was retrieving his newspaper too, and he glanced at
me. Smiling, I offered a friendly wave.  He paused, then slowly returned my
greeting.  His perplexed and strange manner made me wonder.  Then I
remembered - I sleep in the nude.

   "Your third wish?" demanded the leprechaun on my desk.<p>

   "I don't recall two others."<p>

   "Foolish human!  Wish two erased all effects and memories of wish one.
I'm busy -- wish your third NOW!"<p>

   I thought; grinned.  "I wish to be irresistable to women."<p>

   He gestured precisely.  "Done".
   "Ironic," he mused, fading away. "Same as wish one."<p>

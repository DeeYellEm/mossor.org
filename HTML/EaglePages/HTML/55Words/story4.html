   I advanced quickly.  One remaining competitor, in poor cash position,
directors' meeting today.  We meet in the restroom.<p>

   "Charles, you're history.  No liquidity; I'll become chairman today."<p>

   "Perhaps.  As of yesterday, I control your holding company."  My blind spot.
"Jennifer emptied your desk, mister vice-president."<p>

   Washed up, I faced him.  His hand extended.<p>

   "Partner?"<p>

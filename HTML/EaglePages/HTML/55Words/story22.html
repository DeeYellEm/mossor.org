Joe spends many hours designing a 
highly classified fighter jet.
The aerodynamics and arsenal capabilities
designed are far superior to others.
During one of many flights - Joe, climbing into
the cockpit, notices a splat of white _stuff_
on the instrumentation.  He cleans it off and
then flys off - only to crash and burn.

The light shone awkwardly, slanting in through the only<br>
opening and just to the left. It was predictable, and full<br>
of oblong holes like an over stuffed cliche. Through the<br>
dust, a song appeared to touch the ground. The movement<br>
stopped, jumped, and disappeared. Too much, too soon, too<br>
little, too late. The end.

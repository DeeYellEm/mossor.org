The signals travelled through space till we received them from the
little blue planet.  Eventually we decoded them, making sense of the
messages.  At last, fellow intelligences!<p>

Art, philosophy, wisdom.  Anger, judgement, hate.  All traveling at the
same speed, in all directions.<p>

Hundreds of light years and nothing on TV.<p>

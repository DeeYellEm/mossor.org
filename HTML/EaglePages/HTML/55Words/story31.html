  Move quietly.  Stealthy like a fox.  Slowly slide the barrel of my
gun around the corner.<br>
  There's the enemy, back to me.  Haven't been spotted.  <br>
  Sight down the barrel.  Close one eye.  Exhale.  Squeeze the
trigger.<br>
  Perhaps sensing his fate, my enemy spins at the last moment.<br>
  <b><u>THWACK</u></b> goes the nerf dart on his forehead.

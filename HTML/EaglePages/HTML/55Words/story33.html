  Body rigid, stiff.  Lifeless eyes filmed over, sightless and empty.<p>

  I drew the short straw.  Had to make the corpse disappear or there
would be trouble.  We would <u>pay</u>!  <p>

  The body wouldn't stay gone, like some Hitchcock movie.  There
wasn't enough time!  We'll be caught!<p>

  "Honey, next time <u>you're</u> in charge of flushing the goldfish!"

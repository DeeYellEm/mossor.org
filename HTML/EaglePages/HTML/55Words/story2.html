"Dear John,"
</pre>

Success in 8 months.  Drove Mary to my best friend.  No alimony, minimal
child support, bliss with lovely Anika.<p>

<pre>
"We have the children.  We are in love, and will raise them well.
Will write later when settled."<p>
</pre>

I punched Anika's number.  On the third ring, I noticed the signatures:<p>

<pre>
	    "Sincerely,
		Mary and Anika"
</pre>

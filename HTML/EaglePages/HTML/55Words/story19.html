   In 1630, he lost three fingers in a cart wheel hub.  Gangrene.   <br>
Reincarnated, he neglected his steam locomotive's pressure release <br>
valve.  1961:  he kicked the jack while doing transmission work. <br>
2047: Collapsed his Honda's fusion singularity containment field.<p>

Now?  Starcruiser chief engineer.  I admire his soul.  But I can <br>
hardly wait for the fireworks.

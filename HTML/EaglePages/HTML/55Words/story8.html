<H1>Uh-oh</H1>

<hr>
God gets around to looking in on Earth every 20,000 years.
He notices with pleasure the huge number of salmon in its great rivers. 
They will evolve into the most enlightened race of beings in the
universe, 
bringing peace to trillions.<p>

His mind at ease, he moves on.<p>
What could happen in 20,000 years?

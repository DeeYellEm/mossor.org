Hi,

Just a short update.  It's Wednesday.  We made it to Paris.
Luggage didn't.  The phone in the hotel doesn't allow hook up
to a computer -- we're in a little Internet shop on Rue des Ecoles.
Appropriate.

The cables for the digital camera are being Fedexed.  Hope
to get them Thursday -- otherwise, well, it will be 100 pictures
of Paris and then nothing else.

We did make it, although the good part is coming.  It's actually
quite nice here, but the start of the trip, almost missing
the connection having our seats freed up leaves a bad taste
in my mouth to start with.

I'll be more detailed later.  It the cable ever comes, I'll have pictures
later, too.

Hope all goes well with you.  Say "hi" to everyone.

Cheers,
Rainer

<h1>Rainer Paper Dolls</h1>
So, Rainer is off to Europe for five weeks.  To avoid any separation
anxiety, and to allow us to vicariously live through him while
simultaneously have fun at his expense, we have the following paper
dolls with seven handpainted outfits for Rainer.<p>
Feel free trade them with friends!  Get the whole set!<p>
<b>Note:</b>If you print them on card stock, they stand up very
nicely.<p>

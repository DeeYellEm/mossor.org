<i>[Note: If you have no interest in hearing about my adventures in my]<br>
[first week back, delete this now.                                 ]</i><p>


I'd like to take few minutes to thank everyone involved in making me
feel welcome my first week back.  To each and everyone one of you,
feel free to swing by and pick up your own personal restraining order
when you get a chance.<p>


I'd like to note a few of my favorites, just to make sure they're
documented in case of future law suits:<p>


First Runner Up: The lunch ditch.  This went off very nicely and
special recognition should go to Gordon for successfully ditching me
in the bathroom of CPR after completing his business in 2.4 seconds.
A certificate for a free visit to the Urologist of his choice awaits
him upon request.<p>


The award for the most successful prank: The Training Video.<p>


This one caught me completely by surprise.  I came back to my office
late Wednesday to discover a video on my chair with a note from Shelly
indicating that this was the latest "vision" video, "A Conversation
with Aart" and that I needed to view it and get it back to her by
tomorrow.  Grrrrrr.  Fine.<p>


So, I get home late, like 6:50pm, late for dinner and my wife tells me
I need to take my son to Scouts at 7pm.  I probably knew this once but
had forgotten it.  Out the door I go, son in tow, sans dinner.  We get
home again about 9pm and I still have to watch the silly video.
Double Grrrrrr.<p>


I take a snack upstairs and pop that sucker in the VCR.  Music rises,
scenes of Synopsys abound.  Voice over describing "Moore's Law" and
Synopsys' goal to keep up with it, yadda yadda yadda.  My eyes are
drooping already.  About five minutes in, the silly tape seems to skip
back about 30 seconds and replay the previous boring part.  Two
minutes later, it happens again.  Now I'm steaming!<p>


Then, in the middle of some scene of several professionally dressed
women chatting, I get Casablanca!  Just about a 30 seconds or so.  I
rewind to see if I missed the segue that would make that make sense.
Nope.  Okay, now I'm really cheesed.  I'm looking at a mangled tape!
I sit through several more minutes of the tape inadvertently skipping
back to reiterate a point.  I'm now at full boil.  <p>


Suddenly, the tape jumps to the last scene of Casablanca ("This
is the beginning of a beautiful friendship...").  Which, by the
way, is way better than the Synopsys video, so I watch that
instead, not fast forwarding.  Credits begin to roll, my finger
hovers over the fast forward button when suddenly ... I'm greeted
by a shot of the entire group welcoming me back!  It was
priceless.  I was stunned.  I sat there for what seemed like
forever with my jaw around my knees then began laughing so loud
that my wife came up to see what in the video was so funny.  It
was great.  And whoever did it (*cough*Bart) is not going to get
his/her(/Bart's) tape back.  So there.<p>


Now, for some additional awards and recognition:<p>


The "Oh, look, I'm being stalked" award goes to person(s) that cut out
the advertisements and replaced the heads with mine.  This
demonstrates either alot of effort or too much time.<p>


Honorable Mention: The Bewitched/"Welcome back
Derwood/Donnie/Doug/etc" posters.  These seemed to come back up
nearly as quickly as I could take them down.<p>


The "It's like I never left" award.  I arrived in my office to
discover that indeed I had a machine, it's just that it's a P100 PC
that refuses to boot.  Rainer arrives to help me install rain, the new
Solaris box.  I log in, remembering the Synopsys default password, and
my silly environment returns just exactly as I left it!  It appears
everything has been restored.  Rainer mentions that I might want to
check my email, so I do, finding 190 messages!  Rainer was kind enough
to turn on my email almost two weeks earlier!  Whatta guy ;-)<p>


The "Almost, but not quite" award goes to whoever attempted to
recreate the spinning business card of death and the hole punches
that I am supposed to have done to Jaci.  (Okay, I did do it.
But mine worked.  But, using Geoff's Japanese business card was a
nice touch.)  In this case, I opened the drawer, the card came
around once, impacted the pile of hole punches and stopped.  Too
bad, that would have been fun.  If the perpetrator would like to
stop by, I can show them what went wrong and how to fix it in the
future.<p>


The "I gotta find some new tricks" award to whoever changed the web
page icon and successfully chown/chmod'd it to look like I did it over
a year ago.  I didn't realize I got nailed for that one (the
chown/chmod part).<p>


I'm sure I forgot to mention a few (like the pieces of paper in the
phone connections, keeping me from reporting that my phone was busted
or a nameplate that finally spells my name like everyone else seems to
think my name should be spelled), so if I missed your favorite, I'm
sorry.<p>


Finally, once again, my thanks to everyone for helping to make my
first week back very memorable.<p>

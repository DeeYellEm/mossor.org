This late breaking news just in from DAC.  While looking over one of
the DAC pictures provided by an anonymous source (hereafter referred
to as "Sore Throat"), something caught my eye.  In one of the
pictures, one of our Eagle brethren seems to have something in his
hand.  You can see the picture at right.

<p>Curious about what might be in his hand, I contacted "Sore Throat"
and it turns out that in addition to the missing Pentium reported last
week, other Pentiums were missing from Viewlogic machines.  No
suspects had been identified but authorities were baffled.
Additionally, all union workers have been cleared of suspicion.
Authorities feel that it may, in fact, have been an inside job.

<p>I dug a little further and contacted the manager of the brewpub
where the Eagle team ate dinner at the end of Day 3.  According to the
manager of the establishment, the suspect ordered several bottles of
expensive wine.  When it came time to pay the bill, the suspect
flashed what others at the table thought was a credit card.  The
waiter disappeared and the bill was taken care of!  The manager claims
that the bill was paid in cash.  Small bills, nothing larger than a
$20.  No one at the table recalls any cash changing hands.

<p>Further investigation reveals that the brewpub, "The NanoBrew",
part of a chain of aCalifornia brewpubs owned by the McPentimum
brothers, is known as a "Silicon Safe House", a new crime
establishment known for trafficking in hot silicon.  In a strange
twist on classic money laundering techniques, officials reveal that
hot silicon is traded for hot food and beer.  These "Silicon Safe
Houses" are doing a booming business in California.  The stolen
silicon finds it's way onto the black market or as part of a package
deal in the brewpub.  According to the authorities, this week's
brewpub special is a "Pitcher and a Pentium" for $200.

Now for the shocking proof of this heinous crime.  Obviously this
budding crimelord had no idea that he was being caught on film.  Using
the latest in digital enhancement technology, this reporter took it
upon himself to determine the truth in this case.  The results speak
for themselves in the photo to the left.

<p>This is truely a sad day in Eagle history.  It is our firm hope
that the perpetrator can be brought to justice, reformed and
hopefully one day, reintegrated into society.  We wish him
luck.

<p>With the close of this report, this can be considered the end of
"PentiumGate".  Let's all hope that this dark day shall serve as a
reminder to those that would perpetrate evil in the world that silicon
was meant to be free!  I mean really!  All it is is a little precious
metal, some sand and some floating point routines with errors in them.
Is that really worth going to the Big House and being known in your
cell block as "Silicon Sally"?  I don't think so.<p> Good night.

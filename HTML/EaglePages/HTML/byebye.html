Yes, I'm off to join the agency that took mankind to the moon and
brought back Tang and Velcro (tm). The upcoming launch of Senator John
Glenn to study the effects weightlessness on the 'youth challenged'
opens a new era as NASA will begin to test the effects of
weightlessness on people that do not necessarily match the NASA
stereotype for astronauts.<p>

NASA has been investigating weighlessness for 40 years now, but all of
their data is confined to guys that weigh 150 pounds, stand 5'6" high
and usually sport a nifty crewcut.  Now they're after some data from
other segments of society.  With me they kill two birds with one stone
by covering both the tall and the, um, big-boned.  So what does this
mean?  It means I'm going up <b>ON THE SHUTTLE!</b> On the down side,
NASA said they'll have to leave behind some emergency fuel, but what
the hell.  Gravity is on my side, anyway.<p>

The photo above came from my final round of candidate screening six
weeks ago.  This was after five hours in a suit and after weeks of
practicing the Zen art of not thinking about wetting myself.  I'm
pretty sure there's a Zen art for that.<p>

My departure may seem abrupt, but no, I'm not leaving on short
notice.  Geoff wanted to delay announcement until Rainer's return.<p>

My 2+ years with the group have without question been the most fun and
most productive years of my career, and leaving this group is the
hardest professional decision I've had to make.  But in the end, this
was a challenge and an opportunity that I just couldn't pass up.<p>

I wish to express my thanks and appreciation to everyone in the Eagle
team for making the last two and a half years such a great experience.
I move off to pursue new challenges knowing that the Eagle team has
all the people and pieces in place to dominate HW/SW co-verification,
create world class tools and have a great time doing it.  As much as
part of me is looking forward to my new responsibilities, a large part
of me sincerely wishes I could be around to be a part of Eagle's
continued success.<p>

Thanks everyone.<p>

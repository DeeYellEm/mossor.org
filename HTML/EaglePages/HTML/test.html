In a surprise announcement, Darrin Mossor has announced plans to leave
Synopsys to join NASA for an upcoming shuttle launch.  He will be leaving
the company Friday, October 30th to begin training for his mission.<p>

When asked about the apparently abrupt announcement, officials at
Synopsys stated that they had been aware of Mr. Mossor's plans some
time ago but chose to delay the announcement until the return of
Rainer Wieland, manager extraordinaire, both to smooth the transition
as well as to allow Mr. Wieland to share in person his feelings about
the change.<p>

The upcoming launch of Senator John Glenn to study the effects
weightlessness on the 'youth challenged' opens a new era as NASA will
begin to test the effects of weightlessness on people that do not
necessarily match the NASA stereotype for astronauts.<p>

NASA spokesman Gary Branson was quoted as saying "We already know what
weightlessness is like when you weigh 150 pounds and you're 5'6.
We've been doing that for 40 years or so.  We'd like know what it's
like if you're tall.  Or, um, large.  Mr. Mossor allows us to kill two
birds with one stone since he's pretty damn tall and, you have to
admit, he's pretty 'big-boned', if you know what I mean."  NASA plans
on leaving behind some emergency fuel to compensate for the additional
mass.<p>

Mr. Mossor added "I've had over two years of great fun and learning in
the Eagle group.  Leaving this group is the most difficult decision
I've made in my professional career.  But, I have a new challenge to
pursue now, something new, with a small team and I'm looking forward
to learning a new set of skills."<p>

After leaving Mr. Mossor can be reached either via his home email

or via his new NASA email address
<a href="mailto:darrinm@model.com">darrinm@model.com</a><p>

Finally, at the close of the short announcement, Mr. Mossor made the
following statement: "I wish to express my thanks and appreciation to
everyone in the Eagle team for making the last two and a half years
the best years I've spent in my career.  With great confidence, I move
off to pursue new challenges knowing that the Eagle team has all the
skills to move forward, dominating HW/SW co-verification and creating
world class tools.  As much as part of me is looking forward to my new
responsibilities, part of me sincerely wishes I could be around to be
a part of Eagle's continued success.  Thanks everyone."<p>

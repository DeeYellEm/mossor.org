This is what I built on my recent vacation.  I found the plans on the
web and you can access them below.  The chair could even be built by a
complete neophyte like myself, to pretty good effect.  The downside
is, given the cost of materials and tools (bought myself a router!)
and even putting a nominal value on my time, this is certainly the
most expensive chair I've ever owned.  But, it was a lot of fun.<p>

Oh, and I do realize that pine is not the best choice, expecially from
the perspective of being knot-free.  But, it was the most cost
effective choice for the first piece of wood furniture I've ever
built.<p>

				<P>So, I was reading a great book I saw referred to on the A:M list
				  recently (<A
				  HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1562059548/103-7432248-6819822">[digital]
				  Lighting and Rendering</A>) and saw a neat picture of a subway scene. Long
				  story short I got to thinking about modeling a garbage can. What's the best way
				  to build such a thing?</P> 
				<P>Turns out, as with most good things in
				  <A HREF="http://www.hash.com">A:M</A>, there's more than one way to skin that
				  cat. This tutorial will discuss a few of the pros and cons of the three
				  approaches I came up with. This tutorial is simple but hopefully will save
				  someone some time or spark a new approach to solving a problem.</P> 
				<P>Modeling a garbage can like the one in the image above can be
				  done in (at least) three different ways:</P> 
				<OL> 
				  <LI>Geometry</LI> 
				  <LI>Bump Maps</LI> 
				  <LI>Displacement Maps</LI> 
				</OL><BR> 
				<H2>Geometry</H2> 
				<P>If you look at the image above, you can see that there is a fair
				  amount of detail in the ribbing on the sides and round the top and bottom. You
				  could certainly model all that, but given that I also wanted to add some
				  imperfections, doing that on a CP by CP basis didn't seem attractive. Plus I
				  was looking for an opportunity to try out a mapping solution. Geometry is not a
				  solution to overlook, but let's see what else is available.</P><BR> 
				<H2>Bump Maps</H2> 
				<P>Here is the basic mesh for the garbage can. It's just a simple
				  line lathed with 16 cross sections.</P> 
				<TABLE BORDER="1"> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TH BGCOLOR="#000000">The basic mesh</TH> 
				  </TR> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TD><IMG SRC="Images/example_lowmesh.jpg" BORDER="0"
						ALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="294">&nbsp;</TD> 
				  </TR> 
				</TABLE> 
				<P>Maps or decals can be used for a wide variety of things
				  including altering the geometry of an otherwise smooth mesh. The method I see
				  most often is the Bump map and that's what I started off with. Since this is a
				  decal the first step was to prepare the decal.</P> 
				<P>Here is the basic decal I started with to emulate the bumps in
				  my can. This is a basic pill shape replicated with a light Gaussian blur
				  applied to the top and bottom portions and a larger blur applied to the pill
				  shapes. Then a noise filter was applied to the entire image. Remember that Bump
				  maps have to have a smooth transition between lighter/darker (or vice versa,
				  thus the blur) to work correctly and look good.</P> 
				<TABLE BORDER="1"> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TH BGCOLOR="#000000">The basic bump map for the garbage
						can</TH> 
				  </TR> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TD>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="Images/dispmap.jpg" WIDTH="600"
						HEIGHT="300" BORDER="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></TD> 
				  </TR> 
				</TABLE> 
				<P>This decal can be applied in a couple different ways. You could
				  create a new material and make it a projection map and choose the cylindrical
				  mapping. Another option is to flatten the front and back halves and apply the
				  bump map decal to front and back. This is the option I chose. I won't go into
				  the details of flattening since others can explain this powerful yet mystical
				  feature better than I.</P> 
				<P>The results of applying this and a simple graffiti color map
				  image came out like this:</P> 
				<TABLE BORDER="1"> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TH BGCOLOR="#000000">The bump mapped results</TH> 
				  </TR> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TD><IMG SRC="Images/example_bump.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="295"
						BORDER="0"></TD> 
				  </TR> 
				</TABLE><BR> 
				<P>Now, this is the above bump map applied at about 800%. The
				  indentations are about the right size but note something about the sides. The
				  bumps don't actually alter the mesh along the top and bottoms as you might
				  expect. From the A:M Manual: </P> 
				<P>"Because bumps maps do not actually change the shape of the
				  underlying surface (they are more of a visual trick), the surface&#146;s
				  profile shape is not affected. An otherwise irregular bump map will still
				  appear smooth when viewed along the surface&#146;s profile."</P> 
				<P>So, while bump maps give us the general appearance that we're
				  looking for, the edges just don't look right. For that reason a bump map is
				  probably not a great solution for this problem is I actually want to see the
				  detail. So, what about Displacement Maps?</P> 
				<H2>Displacement Maps</H2> 
				<P>Displacement Maps are another decal type. Again from the A:M
				  Manual:</P> 
				<P>"Displacement maps actually affect the object&#146;s surface,
				  making real bumps but they are computationally and memory expensive, and are
				  also more difficult to control."</P> 
				<P>So, the basic idea is that any color value less than (lighter
				  than) 128 will displace into our can and value greater will displace out from
				  our can. So, back to our image. First I had to invert and normalize the colors
				  so the white had a value of 128. I got odd looking results if I didn't do this.
				  I also decided to go nuts on the imperfections and severly mucked around with
				  the original image. Here is the result:</P> 
				<TABLE BORDER="1"> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TH BGCOLOR="#000000">The dirtied up displacement map for the
						garbage can</TH> 
				  </TR> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TD>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="Images/dispmap3.jpg" WIDTH="600"
						HEIGHT="300" BORDER="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></TD> 
				  </TR> 
				</TABLE> 
				<P>Now something interesting I discovered is that while decals
				  support the displacement type, unfortunately the Projection Map material plugin
				  seems to support all decal/map types except displacement. So, this is the real
				  reason I chose to use the flatten/decal approach mentioned earlier. Now I can
				  take my previous decals, change the image to this new one, change the type to
				  Displacement and set it to a value of about 1.2%. 100% will result in a
				  severely bloated garbage can. Since displacement is measured in centimeters
				  (cm) you only need a small value for our mesh.</P> 
				<P>So, how are we doing?</P> 
				<TABLE BORDER="1"> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TH BGCOLOR="#000000">The displacement mapped results on the
						simple mesh.</TH> 
				  </TR> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TD><IMG SRC="Images/example_lowdisp.jpg" WIDTH="300"
						HEIGHT="295" BORDER="0"></TD> 
				  </TR> 
				</TABLE> 
				<P>Okay, Ewww. That's not good. How come? Well, a bit of research
				  and some serendipitous reading of Jeremy Birn's "Lighting and Rendering" book
				  mentioned that displacement maps depend on a mesh with more complexity.
				  Aha!</P> 
				<P>So, let's build a better barrel (more patches is better):</P> 
				<TABLE BORDER="1"> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TH BGCOLOR="#000000">The more complex cylinder mesh - better
						for displacement</TH> 
				  </TR> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TD><IMG SRC="Images/example_mesh.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="295"
						BORDER="0"></TD> 
				  </TR> 
				</TABLE> 
				<P>How many is enough? I dunno. You'll need to experiment based on
				  your model and application.</P> 
				<P>So, now that we've altered our model, how are we doing?</P> 
				<TABLE BORDER="1"> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TH BGCOLOR="#000000">The displacement mapped results on the
						more complex mesh</TH> 
				  </TR> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TD><IMG SRC="Images/example_disp.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="295"
						BORDER="0"></TD> 
				  </TR> 
				</TABLE> 
				<P>(Actually this uses our displacement map before I "dirtied" it
				  up, so it still looks a bit perfect, but you'll see where we're going in the
				  final render.)</P> 
				<P>So, we're getting there! Now we have our detail <B>and</B> as
				  you look at the profile we have the detail actually affecting the profile of
				  the model, which is much nicer. So, with just a simple image map applied as a
				  displacement map we've emulated a much more complex model in much less work
				  (which is a good thing).</P> 
				<P>Let's toss this bad boy into a simple choreography, throw on a
				  few handles, a bit more graffiti and a lid and see what we have:</P> 
				<TABLE BORDER="1"> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TH BGCOLOR="#000000">The mostly final results</TH> 
				  </TR> 
				  <TR> 
					 <TD><IMG SRC="Images/example_final.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="400"
						HEIGHT="300"></TD> 
				  </TR> 
				</TABLE> 
				<P>Note how the changes in profile and dents catch the light and
				  shadows as you'd expect. That's cool.</P> 
				<H2>Conclusion</H2> 
				<P>I'll leave to the reader the additional fun of adding diffusion
				  and specular maps. You probably ought to consider adding some scuff marks and
				  discolorations, too, since this is a pretty clean looking garbage can, but not
				  bad for a simple cylinder and a simple map, right?</P> 
				<P>Keep in mind that Displacement Maps will consume more memory and
				  time during rendering but the results can be well worth it.</P> 
				<P>Hopefully you'll find an application for displacement maps in
				  something you're working on and I hope this helped.</P>

				<P>A question that has come up on the list a few times over the
				  years is: "How do I animate a character writing something, either on paper or
				  on a, say, a chalkboard? There are ways to do it, but the answers seemed like
				  they took a lot of work to fake the effect. You could do anything including
				  animated decals where you erase the writing over a series of frames then
				  reverse the frames to animated transparency maps. These then meant you had to
				  animate the pencil or chalk being at the right point for where the writing is.
				  Ugh. Lots of work.</P>
				<P>So take a look at the problem solved differently, then come back
				  and see yet another way to solve the problem. The animation is
				  <A HREF="Downloads/WritiingSprites.mov">here</A> (QuickTime, On2 Codec, 537k,
				  10s)</P> 
				<P>One of the keen new features in v9.5 gives us another option:
				  Sprites or Sprticles. There's some great examples of very nice explosions and
				  fires and clouds of smoke. Here's an example of using the effect for a bit of a
				  different purpose. Let's use sprites to do the writing and let the system do
				  all (or at least most) of the hard work for us!</P> 
				<H2>Step 1: The path</H2> 
				<P>Very simply, we need a path to write on to start with. In my
				  case I wrote what I wanted to see on a sticky, scanned it in, created a new
				  model, created a rotoscope of my sticky I scanned and simply created a path
				  along my writing, applying CPs where I needed them. Below are images of my scan
				  and the resultant path, after removing the roto. The final image of the three
				  is the bird's eye view of the path. I elevated several of the CPs to simulate
				  picking up the pencil as you go from one word to another.</P>

				<H2>Step 2: The Pencil Model</H2> 
				<P>Now that I have a path to write along, I need something to write
				  with and it needs to be able to write.</P> 
				<P>My thanks for Jeremy Fernsler for his model of a pencil modeled
				  completely with materials. I had to mess with it a bit to get the wood looking
				  alright since it used a ToonNation plugin not currently available on v9.5. In
				  the closeup of the tip of the pencil below, I applied the material we'll create
				  next to the tip of the pencil. Sprite materials didn't want to emit from a ring
				  of CPs (the *very* tip of the pencil) so I created a group of the very tip and
				  next ring up so there would be actual patches for the sprites to emit from.</P>
				<H3>The Pencil Model</H3><IMG SRC="Images/PencilTip.jpg" BORDER="0"
				WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="336"> 
				<H2>Step 3: The Material</H2> 
				<P>To create a Sprite based material, create a new material and
				  change the main attribute to Sprite Emitter like so:</P><IMG
				SRC="Images/NewMaterial.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="527" HEIGHT="161">
				<P>Now we're going to change the attributes of the material. This
				  part is highly experimental as documentation is still under construction, but
				  most of the changes we'll make are pretty logical. Here's what we'll end up
				  with:</P><IMG SRC="Images/MatDetails.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="433" HEIGHT="268"> 
				<P>Some details:</P>
				<UL>
				  <LI>I set the life to something very long so the sprites wouldn't
					 decay, since we're not after disappearing ink in this project</LI>
				  <LI>The Rate of Emission is a judgement call based on what looks
					 good. By the way, we'll animate this rate later to simulate picking up the
					 pencil, which is the really cool part of this effect..</LI>
				  <LI>Initial Velocity is 0 since we don't want our lead moving.
					 Similarly, Drag at 100% seems to keep the lead where we emit it. Finally for
					 locking down the lead, we set the Gravitational effect to 0% so our lead
					 doesn't sink through the paper.</LI>
				  <LI>Opacity at 100%, size to taste based on chor size, angle
					 random just because</LI>
				</UL>
				<P>These are the highlights, but each has features and controls
				  under the main ones that can help tweak the effect..</P> 
				<P>Finally (or to begin with) we need to set the image we'll emit.
				  In my case I made a simple 32x32 bit image with an alpha channel that started
				  out as the inverted version of the bitmap and then I fiddled with the levels a
				  bit to add some variation. The image is on the left, the alpha channel on the
				  right:</P><IMG SRC="Images/LeadImg.jpg" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="256" BORDER="0">
				<H2>Step 4: The Choreography</H2> 
				<P>I used the default choreography, added a simple patch colored
				  yellow for the sticky and pointed the camera in extreme closeup.</P>
				<P>Next I added the path which represents the writing, slightly
				  raised above the sticky model.</P>
				<P>Next I added the pencil (which has had a bone added with the tip
				  of the bone at the tip of the pencil and the bone applies to all CPs of the
				  pencil. In the chor I added a Constrain to Path to the pencil where the target
				  is the writing path.</P>
				<P>Next I set the Ease on the constraint to 0% at time 00:00:00. I
				  timed myself writing the path earlier so I knew I wanted the path to take about
				  10 seconds. I went to 00:10:00 and set the ease to 100%. The result is the
				  pencil will now travel the path from start to finish in 10 seconds. (Note: The
				  first time I tried this, the pencil attached itself to the end of the path. The
				  splines have some sense of which CPs were added last, which affects which end
				  is the beginning or end. Adding a CP to the end swapped this and fixed it for
				  me. Alternatively, I could have started out with the ease at 100% and worked
				  back to 0% if the sense of direction of the spline was reversed)</P>
				<P>This will result in a pretty even pace across the entire spline,
				  which is not what I wanted, so where the pencil would pick up, from "Animation"
				  to "Master" and "Master" to the flourish at the end, I adjusted the ease on
				  either end of those moves so they would take place more quickly. I also
				  modified the tilt of the pencil so it wouldn't stay simply up and down. This is
				  to taste.</P>
				<H2>Step 5: The Magic</H2> 
				<P>It's never really magic, especially once you how it's done and
				  this isn't all that tricky, I'd just never tried it and it hadn't occurred to
				  me until now. If you do nothing else, the sprites will emit over the entire
				  path, as if the pencil were jammed down the entire time, never picking up. This
				  is unattractive. To address this, I simply animated the Rate of Emission
				  between 100% and 0% depending on where I was on the path. So starting at time
				  00:00:00 I set the rate to 0%. A few frames later I set it again to 0% the
				  immediately to 100% in the next frame. If I didn't do that it would interpolate
				  between the original 0% and the first 100% ramping up between (there may be an
				  interpolation setting that would have addressed this but I just winged it and
				  this approach worked just fine).</P> 
				<P>Here is what the chor looked like as I animated the Rate of
				  Emission (just so you know what I saw so you see the same thing):</P><IMG
				SRC="Images/AnimChor.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="513"> 
				<P>So while it's not necessarily magic, it is the tedious part of
				  the exercise. You need to scrub along setting the Rate of Emission between 100
				  and 0 based on whether we're actually writing or not.. (Note: SAVE OFTEN. I
				  live this and still got bit a few times when things went south and I had to
				  redo portions). By the time I got the kinks out of the process, it probably
				  took 15 minutes to animate the Rate of Emission.</P> 
				<H2>Some Notes:</H2>
				<P>One thing I was worred about was that sprites are emitted
				  perpendicular to the camera, so I was concerned that as the camera angle
				  changed, it might not look great. The good news is, it seems to work well,
				  especially in a case like this where the sprite emitted is very small (almost a
				  particle - Now that's a thought! I wonder I could have done this with
				  particles! Well, an experiment for another time). Also, the plane that the
				  sprites are emitted on (the plane of the path) stays self-consistent from
				  different camera angles. Basically, it seems to work. Here are a couple shots
				  from the same time and two cameras to demonstrate what I mean.</P><IMG

				<H2>Conclusions</H2> 
				<P>So that's basically it except for the looking at the results and
				  picking apart the project. You'll find links to both below. Please enjoy and as
				  always, feedback good and bad is appreciated, especially as we explore these
				  new features. Thanks, Darrin Mossor</P>

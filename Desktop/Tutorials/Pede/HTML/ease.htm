				<P>This is where the meat of the tutorial is. Everything else led
				  up to this magical moment, so on to the fun!</P> 
				<P>So, what do we need to get our centipede to walk the path as we
				  want him to? First, we need each of the segments to follow the one in front of
				  it. Second, we need each of the Actions applied to the segments to lag the one
				  in front by a bit. That should get us very close to what we want.</P> 
				<P>Go to Basic3Pt-&gt;Shortcut to
				  HeadSeg-&gt;Choreography-&gt;Shortcut to HeadSeg and pick Constrain to Path "1"
				  (Path1). You should see the image below. Note the Ease Channel, the slider at
				  the bottom of the Properties. The Ease channel is a way to say how far, on a
				  given frame, you want the model to be along the path that was specified. With
				  the Current Frame Field at zero, advance the Ease channel slider so that the
				  HeadSeg moves far enough along the path to leave room for the other
				  BodySegs.</P> 
				<P>For each of the other BodySegs, do the same thing, advancing the
				  Ease at time 0 so that each BodySeg is right behind the one in front of it. The
				  slider only seems to advance by 1.0% at a time, but if you need the accuracy,
				  just edit the Ease value. In my case, at time zero, the HeadSeg started at 11%
				  and the last BodySeg started out at 3.4%. Now, advance the scrub bar to the end
				  of our animation (11:09 or whatever). Now repeat the previous step for the
				  HeadSeg down through the BodySeg(5), advancing the Ease channel for each (not
				  the Ease channel in the Walk action!) so that at the end of the animation, the
				  HeadSeg is at the end of the Path1 and each BodySeg finishes right behind the
				  one in front of it.</P><IMG SRC="../Images/EaseChor.jpg" WIDTH="524"
				HEIGHT="443" BORDER="0"> 
				<P>If you scrub through now, you'll notice that we now have a
				  complete centipede, with a HeadSeg and several BodySegs (you could have more,
				  but this gives us the idea). The remaining problem is with the legs. They don't
				  follow just behind the one in front. How do we get this effect? </P> 
				<P>Pretty easily, actually. With the Current Frame Field back at
				  zero, go in to each of the BodySegs and edit the Properties for the Shortcut to
				  Walk. The HeadSeg Starts at 00:00:00. Make the first BodySeg Start at 00:00:02
				  or two frames later. For each of the following segments, make it Start two
				  frames later than the one in front of it. One upshot of this: for the first few
				  frames of the animation, the legs of each following BodySeg will take a few
				  frames to get moving. So, I'd recommend having the Path1 start off camera for
				  long enough for the legs to get moving. In my case, the last BodySeg got moving
				  after 10 frames.</P> 
				<P>Now, we could stop there, but let's do one more section to add
				  some life to this creature for very little extra work. Go to the next section
				  to add some more Actions that will help liven things up.</P> </TD>

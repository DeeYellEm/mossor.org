				<P>Paths are cool. paths will tell our actor (model, whatever)
				  where to go.</P> 
				<P>In this case, open our Basic3Pt choreography that we created
				  earlier. Go to the top view. In the upper left corner, you should see an arrow
				  with a plus sign (+) next to it. This is the add Path button. I prefer the
				  shortcut (A), so we'll use that. Hit A and click in your choreography. While
				  holding down the mouse button, drag away in the direction you'd like your model
				  to follow. Release when you get part way there. Let's assume we're going to
				  have several turns, so we'll need more CPs. Hit A again and click near the end
				  of the segment we created, you should now have a third CP that you can drag to
				  continue to path. Release when this CP is where you'd like it. Keep doing this
				  until you get enough CPs to get the rough shape that you'd like for the path.
				  Once completed, you can click on and drag individual CPs on the path (probably
				  Path1 in the choreography) and get just the shape and run you want.</P> 
				<P>By default this path will be at '0' in the Y direction or right
				  on our flat patch plane. This is what we want for this tutorial, but it could
				  just as easily go up and over a set of hills you constructed. But's let's walk
				  flat before we climb hills.</P> 
				<P>If all is well, you should now have Path1 in your Basic3Pt
				  choreography. Now, we need to get something to travel this path. </P> 
				<P>Go up to our HeadSeg, click on it (Left click) and drag it down
				  to our choreography, releasing the mouse button once the HeadSeg is over
				  Basic3Pt. You should now have a HeadSeg in the choreography. WooHoo! Pretty
				  exciting, right? No, probably not. But now let's make it do something...</P> 
				<P>Right click on the HeadSeg, select New Constraint-&gt;Path. Move
				  to the Choreography window and the pointer should have turned in to the
				  eyedropper. Click near Path1 and now the model is constrained to travel along
				  Path1. If you advance the scrub bar, you should see the HeadSeg move along the
				  path. Now let's get it walking!</P> 
				<P>Drag the Walk Action down and drop it on HeadSeg in the Basic3Pt
				  choreography in the PWS. Click on the new Shortcut to Walk under HeadSeg in the
				  Choreography and look at the Properties. You should have "Use Stride Length"
				  checked.</P> 
				<P>If you drag the scrub bar now, you should see our HeadSeg hustle
				  along the length of the Path1 in just 30 frames. Much too fast to look stylish.
				  Also, unless we modify things, we're still using all 30 frames even though we
				  don't want the last frame. In the Properties, change the Start and End in the
				  Crop Range to go from 0 to 29. The "Out Of" field will still say 30. Now, under
				  How to Execute, be sure Use Stride Length is checked and change the End to
				  something longer, like (what I ended up with for my Path length (it's all a
				  matter of taste): 11:09. Here is what my Properties look like:</P><IMG

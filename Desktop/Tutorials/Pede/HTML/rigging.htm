				<P>In this case, by rigging, I mean to add the necessary bones to
				  the model to allow us to animate. In this case, because of the simplicity of
				  the model, we will not be using any constraints on the body itself since we'll
				  be creating only a very simple set of repeated actions.</P> 
				<P>Okay, enough of that, let's set some bones! Bring up your
				  HeadSeg model in it's window. Let's hit '4' to get a left view. Now, let's get
				  in to Bones mode (if you're not there already). On the bar across the top
				  (again, assuming a default interface), you should see a small bone. Click on
				  it. Looks like this:
				  <IMG SRC="../Images/BonesMode.jpg" WIDTH="224" HEIGHT="72" BORDER="0"
					ALIGN="TEXTTOP"></P> 
				<P>Time to set some bones. Click on the Add Bone button on the
				  right side of the screen (for the last time, assuming a standard placement.
				  Looks like this:
				  <IMG SRC="../Images/AddBone.jpg" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="131" BORDER="0"
					ALIGN="TEXTTOP"></P> 
				<P>Now click (when I say click, I mean Left Mouse Button (LMB)
				  click - if I say Right Click, well, it's the other one - RMB) inside our
				  HeadSeg and now drag (while holding down the LMB) towards the back of the body,
				  stopping with the bone still inside the body. Now let up on the LMB. You should
				  now have your first bone in the HeadSeg. Now check the alignment in the body by
				  hitting '5' (Top View) and being sure the bone runs down the middle (more or
				  less) of the body. If it's misaligned, click in the middle of the bone (between
				  the two yellow highlighted ends) and drag it so it sits where you want it. You
				  can also drag each of the endpoints by clicking on them and dragging.
				  Congratulations, we've set our first bone!</P> 
				<P>A quick word about hierarchy in bones. Let's say we set another
				  bone right now (go ahead and try - we can always delete it later). Now,
				  assuming you haven't done anything in the interrim, you should see in the
				  Project Workspace window our new bone Bone2 is the child of Bone1. You can see
				  the relationship by it's name sitting below and slightly inset relative to
				  Bone1. As a child of the parent Bone1, if Bone1 translates (moves) Bone2 will
				  follow it. Sometimes this is what you want and sometimes it's not. If you
				  didn't want Bone2 to be the child of Bone1, you can simply click and hold on
				  Bone2 and drag it up on to the model name and let go. Now it sits at the same
				  level as Bone1.</P> 
				<P>Now, let's set the leg bones for the legs. Click on the model
				  name. Hit '2' for a front view and hit 'a' (Add Bone). Click and drag a bone to
				  go along the upper left (your left) portion of leg. Now hit 4 to check the
				  orientation from the left. Odds are you'll need to move it in to the leg from
				  this view. Now switch back to the front view ('2') and add a lower leg bone to
				  the lower leg. Note that it should be a child of the parent upper leg bone.</P>
				
				<P>Now let's rename those bones to something more descriptive than
				  Bone1/2/3. Click on Bone1, hit F2 (rename) and type the new name, something
				  descriptive like Body. Now do the same for Bone2 and Bone3, renaming them to
				  Right Upper and Right Lower (now the creature's right, not yours).</P> 
				<P>Do the same for the other leg, but remember to click on the
				  model name before laying the upper bone or you'll need to drag that bone and
				  move it up the hierarchy.</P> 
				<P>Now, add a bone each for the eyes and lids and mouth parts for a
				  total of six more. Your bone chain should look like this:
				  <IMG SRC="../Images/BoneHierarchy.jpg" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="220" BORDER="0"
				  ALIGN="TEXTTOP"></P> 
				<P>Now let's assign some CPs (Control Points) to each bone. Switch
				  to the front view ('2') of the model. Now select the Body bone (either in the
				  PWS - Project Workspace or by click on the bone in the model window). Now hit
				  'g' or 'Shift-g' and select a point or two from the body. Now hit '/'. This
				  should select the rest of the body. That was easy! </P> 
				<P>Now do the same for the upper and lower segments of each leg.
				  The mouth segments are probably best selected from the front view while the
				  lids and eyes are probably best selected in Bird's Eye mode. Just click on each
				  bone in turn, the shift-click on a single point of that part then hit '/' to
				  get the rest of that part. You'll note that each part will blink all it's CPs
				  the color of the bone so you can see what you've selected.</P> 
				<P>You should have a fully boned body with body parts assigned to
				  them. Examine the HeadSeg model from the example and be sure yours is defined
				  similarly.</P> 
				<P>We still need to create the BodySeg. Go to Modeling Mode (F5)
				  and select the entire model. Hit ctrl-c (Copy). Now LMB click on Objects in the
				  PWS and select New...-&gt;Model. Now go to Edit-&gt;Paste with Bones and
				  shazam! A copy of the HeadSeg with bones! Saving us time for other things. Be
				  sure to (in Modeling Mode) select and delete the mouth parts and eyes and lids
				  from the BodySeg (be sure to rename your model to BodySeg). A body segment with
				  eyes on this creature would just be *wrong* (or kind of cool - you decide).</P>
				
				<P>So, now we have two models, one of a head (HeadSeg) and one of
				  the body (BodySeg). "Just one body segment?", you might ask. Yes, just one.
				  We're going to use the joys of replication to let A:M handle multiple copies of
				  this one segment, giving us a more complex creature with just two segments. Not
				  bad.</P> 
				<P>Now, one to the Basic Walk Action</P></TD>

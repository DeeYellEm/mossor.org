				<P>If all is going well, what we have now is a HeadSeg in the
				  Choreography with the Walk Action applied to execute using Stride Length over
				  the some number of frames(seconds). As it executes, the legs and body will go
				  through the Walk cycle over and over. That's all well and good, but I, at
				  least, don't see lots of bodiless centipedes wandering around. We need some
				  body segments. Let's say ... 5!</P> 
				<P>Drag 5 BodySeg models down on to Basic3Pt. Right now, they're
				  all just sitting one on top of the other where the X/Y/Z axes cross (the
				  origin). For each of the five BodySegs, do the following:</P> 
				<P>Right Click on each, choose New Constraint-&gt;Path and choose
				  Path1. Drag the Walk action to each BodySeg. Modify it's Crop Range properties
				  so it Starts on 0 and Ends on 29 and runs from 00:00:00 to whatever the length
				  was for the HeadSeg in the last section (let's say 11:09 just for the sake of
				  argument).</P> 
				<P>If we scrub the length of the animation now, what will we see?
				  It's definitely not what we hoped for. What we've done is drop one HeadSeg and
				  five BodySegs on to the same path, with the same starting points and ending
				  points. So, all six segments are right on top of each other with no distance
				  between them and all the legs going at the same time. Not right by any measure.
				  What do we want to see? We want each segment to follow the one in front and we
				  want the legs to fire from the front to the back with a small delay from the
				  time the left leg on HeadSeg starts until BodySeg's leg starts, followed by
				  BodySeg (2), BodySeg(3), etc. How are we going to get that? Well, that should
				  be ... Ease-y (sorry, it'll make more sense in a minute).</P> </TD>

				<P>Let's start out by being real clear: I'm going to build a very
				  simple model to work with. After we have the animation more or less done, you
				  could swap it for a more complex and anatomically accurate by just changing
				  which model the Shortcut in the Choreography points to. </P>
				<P>This model will be simple, meaning fast to build, fast to
				  animate. We're going for results, not something that is going to fool the
				  National Geographic people. I'm also going to assume you have at least read and
				  understood the Basic Splinesmanship tutorials so you have a grasp on the
				  tools.</P> 
				<P>Let's start with head segment. In this case, the body is made of
				  a simple arc which was extruded front and backwards then rotated forward (or
				  back), scaled and tweaked. The legs are two segments each extruded from a
				  simple four sided shape then rotated and tweaked. The eyes are simple spheres
				  and the lids hemispheres with the central spline extruded and scaled. The
				  mandibles are the same four-sided shape extruded and tweaked a couple times.
				  Satisfied with this, I clicked on Model1, hit F2 and typed HeadSeg in the
				  textbox to rename the model.</P><IMG SRC="../Images/HeadSeg.jpg" ALT="HeadSeg"
				ALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="282" BORDER="0"> 
				<P>The body segment is a copy of the HeadSeg with the eyes and
				  mandibles removed.</P> 
				<P>The eyes have a simple decal for the cornea and pupil. The skin
				  is a simple CellTurb combiner with two color attributes.</P> 
				<P>Yes, this was rushed and lacks detail, but this isn't where the
				  fun stuff is for the tutorial. (Plus you can download the project at the end
				  and take that apart to your heart's content). Let's move on to the (even more
				  basic) rigging.</P> 
				<P>Here are some great tutorials to cover basic modeling: TinCan's

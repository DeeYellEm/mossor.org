	 <H1>A Chessboard and Pieces</H1> 
	 <P>I'm in-between things right now and wanted to build something small and
		manageable. I settled on a chessboard and pieces since I wanted to donate the
		model for general use and I hadn't seen one for free.</P> 
	 <P>Pretty much built in a evening. Rotoed a picture of a chess set and set
		to modeling. The horse is a bit funky and the bishop has some spline weirdness
		in the slot in the head that I didn't go back and correct. It wasn't obvious to
		me how to model around it properly, so I moved on.</P> 
	 <P>Below is a thumbnail for the image which links to a larger version</P> 
	 <P>Some facts:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>A simple material for the marble pieces</LI> 
		<LI>A slightly odd one for the wood</LI> 
		<LI>No real material on the pieces</LI> 
		<LI>Spec/Diff maps on the wood and marble, Bump on the wood</LI> 
		<LI>Simple three light choreography</LI> 
		<LI>Roughly 1800 patches on the board, 350 or so per piece (x5
		  pieces)</LI>

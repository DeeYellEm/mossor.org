	 <H1>A Wooden Maquette</H1> 
	 <P>My last <A HREF="../Danse/index.html">animation</A> (okay, only one of
		length) starred this little wooden doll. You know the articulated ones with
		ball joints that sits painfully upon a brass rod and wooden stand. When I did
		the animation, I had no rig and only basic bones. It worked fine, but anything
		more complicated would have been even more painful.</P> 
	 <P>Fast forward a long time. I wanted to try applying the new A:M 2001 Rig
		to something. What better since my model wouldn't require any SmartSkin (which
		I haven't used yet). So, Mac became my first boning project. He turned out
		pretty good and now he's happily articulated and much easier to animate.</P> 
	 <P>Below is an image of Mac in several poses (all included at no cost -
		worth what you paid for it! ;-)</P> 
	 <P>All I ask is that if you use him in something, please send me a copy or
		a link so I can see if he ends up anywhere interesting.</P>

	 <P>With this theme I wanted to come up with something that would not
		overwhelm, so the plan was to come up with a composition that would have just a
		touch of blue at the focal point. After playing around with sketches and other
		ideas, I came up with the idea of a blue rose (which doesn't exist in the real
		world) and created a still life around that. I tried to add just enough detail
		in the background and surrounding to balance the image and try to tell a
		story.</P>
	 <P>I'm pretty happy with the results.</P>

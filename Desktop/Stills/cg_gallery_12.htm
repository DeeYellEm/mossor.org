			 <P>An even keener thing has occurred for The Cube Farm. My image was
				included in "3D Graphics and Animation" by Mark Giambruno. It's included in the
				Gallery section I understand (I'm holding out for my promised free copy!). You
				can order and buy the book on Amazon

			 <P>A nice surprise today. I normally pick up 3D World Magazine for
				the inspiration and tutorials. It includes a section called Revelation which
				has reader images. The magazine includes an accompanying CD with tutorials,
				demos and more images for the Revelation section that didn't make the
				magazine.</P> 
			 <P>Well, in Issue #20, the Monster's Inc issue, The Cube Farm is
				included on the accompanying disk. Not as good as being in print, but not a bad
				thing all considered.</P> 
			 <P>Here is the magazine cover(click on the image for a larger
				version):</P>

			 <P>Here's my final cut - 140k at 800x600.</P> 
			 <P>The major differences are:</P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>Pulled in Depth of Field in the front since the pipe in the
				  upper right was suffering from a bad transition from fuzzed out to sharp</LI> 
				<LI>Changed pipe in lower let since you could see the cube it
				  sprung from and it was out of skew with all other cubes. I thought it was
				  distracting</LI> 
				<LI>Thickened TechnoPod (tm) support cables and angled them a bit
				  so they didn't get lost in all the vertical lines</LI> 
			 </UL>

			 <P>This started out as an exercise in reusing a single model and in
				bone chains. I started out with the simple cube and a chain of bones assigned
				to the tubes, to allow me to flex the tubes using the bones, attaching one to
				the other by constraining the end bone of a tube to another bone on neighboring
				cube.</P> 
			 <P>Before long I kind of liked to composition. Add some textures,
				some Depth of Field, some moody lighting and a TechnoPod (tm) and I kind of
				like the results. I did play with a background behind the cubes but couldn't
				come up with anything that didn't seem to take away from the interesting stuff
				in the image. As always, any feedback is appreciated. Let me know

			 <P>Here was my first cut for public consumption - 140k at
				800x600.</P>

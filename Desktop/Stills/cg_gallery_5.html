	 <H1>Still Life: Flowers in the Window</H1> 
	 <P>I recently saw an image done Brian Prince (Click
		<A HREF="http://www.bprince.com/WindowB.jpg">here</A> to see the image) that I
		just loved. The lighting and texturing are wonderful. I made it my wallpaper
		background for inspiration.</P> 
	 <P> Finally I decided to take a crack at my own still life. The results are
		below. I accomplished most of what I was hoping for.</P> 
	 <P> The three images below are: </P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>The final final image </LI>

		  feedback from fellow A:M users and friends </LI> 
		<LI> Finally, a series of images showing how the image came together.
		  </LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>I think the feedback helped improve the image a great deal, making it a
		much warmer composition as well as more in line with what I hoped to
		achieve.</P> 
	 <P> The final image (though feedback is still apreciated) (79k): </P>

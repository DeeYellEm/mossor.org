	 <H1>Creature Feature</H1> 
	 <P>This was a simple experiment that had the following goals: </P>
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Create a creature from scratch </LI>
		<LI>Skin him in something approaching photo-realistic fashion </LI> 
	 </UL>
	 <P>The results are not perfect. There are some flaws, specifically with
		some seams between decals that are more visible than I like (the left foreleg
		specifically).</P> 
	 <P>Like most things in life, doing a good job skinning is far harder than
		it looks. Doing more than just a haphazard job is a very time consuming,
		detail-oriented task that requires a great deal of patience. These requirements
		leave me ill-suited for this, but I still have fun.</P>

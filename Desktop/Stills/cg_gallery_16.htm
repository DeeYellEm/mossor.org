	 <P>After seeing way too many commercials for Disney's "Snow White" and
		seeing the magic mirror (you know, "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the
		fairest, etc etc etc), I decided that I needed one of those for myself, so
		decided to see if I could create one.</P> 
	 <P>No great secrets here, the mirror is really a few patches over a hole in
		the wall with the face behind it. The room that the face lives in is set up to
		catch no light, keeping it deep black. At time 1 second, the transparency is 0
		and the reflection is 100. Over 3 seconds (I think), I varied the transparency
		up to 100 and the reflection down to 0.</P> 
	 <P>One caveat, you'll notice that it's not until the mirror is completely
		transparent, showing the face, that the volumetric fog kicks in. This is
		because of the way the volumetrics are implemented. They will not render behind
		patches, regardless of the transparency of the patch. So, I did something sort
		of tricky and once the mirror was completely transparent, I made the model for
		the mirror patches inactive so you could then see the volumetric as I moved it
		up from behind. It's not a complete success, but it's not too bad.</P> 
	 <P>In any case, if there's any interest in the model or project, let me
		know and I'll put it up at <A
		HREF="http://www.animationpitstop.com">www.animationpitstop.com</A> for
		download.</P> 
	 <P>Below are some frames from the animation (7 seconds, 850k, Quicktime4
		Sorenson). You can see the full animation

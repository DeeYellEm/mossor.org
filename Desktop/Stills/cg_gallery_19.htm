	 <H2>Date: 06/23/02</H2> 
	 <P>Let me preface this by admitting to being pretty ignorant about the
		joys, trials and tribulations of ray trace engines. I know enough math to know
		they're complicated and hard to do very well. I'm also very aware of the
		tradeoffs between time to render and quality. Having said that, I have a couple
		images to look at:</P>

		</TR> 
	 </TABLE> 
	 <P>One of the images was rendered by a raytrace engine that was being
		talked about on-list last week. It apparently offers GI (Global Illumination)
		and probably scads of other cool things I'm unclear on. The other was rendered
		directly out of A:M with a simple three-light setup at 1280x960 in 11m, resized
		to 640x480.</P>
	 <P>I compressed my image to a similar size JPG as the original in
		Photoshop. I didn't do anything to the original so if compression artifacts
		crept in I'd expect them to be more or less consistent for the compressed size,
		but I could certainly be wrong.</P> 
	 <P>Here's my question: Which is which and how can you tell?</P> 
	 <P>I'm not looking to bash renderers either for or against A:M. Personally
		I'm very happy with the results I get for the money I spent. The question is
		intended to help teach me what it is I don't know. Why is the other one so much
		better?</P> 
	 <P>To keep things simple, the one on the left is A:M, the other is the
		other renderer. I suppose I could have tried a skylight rig to see what that
		did, but I was pretty happy with the results I got and I don't know enough to
		know why I shouldn't be.</P> 
	 <P>So, if you're interested in educating an ignorant person, please let me
		know. I'd like to learn more. Thanks,</P>
